    <!-- Instructor: So next up,

we'll see how we can use de structuring

to extract values not from an array, but from objects.

And this in my experience, is more commonly used.

It's more practical than destructuring from an array

because it's not all about order.

Often we'll have some object,

like here's an example object representing a user,

and I need to single out

or access a couple of properties frequently.

Let's say that I wanted to get first name

and last name out of here.

One option is just to do this.

Const firstName = and then user.firstName.

And then do the same thing for last name.

Const lastName = user.lastName, right?

And that should give me first name and last name.

And that's fine.

But now imagine I also need to do that for email

and I need to do that for born and died.

So const email.

I'll stop after email.

But if I have four or five different properties

I wanted to single out and do something with,

this gets kind of annoying.

So we can destructure them using a similar syntax.

So we write our let or const

and then curly brackets or curly braces and then user.

And then inside of here,

we need to call out individual properties.

So the order doesn't matter like it does with an array.

We're simply doing it by name.

So the name matters.

If I want email, I need to do that.

There must be a property in here called email.

And I'm making a variable called email with that value.

So these are equivalent.

Make me a variable called email from user.email.

Make me a variable called email from user

under the email property.

So let's verify.

Refresh the page, email,

and harvey@gmail.com.

It works.

So I could do email, firstName, lastName, city, bio.

And that's gonna make me one, two, three, four,

five separate variables.

Here's bio, here's email.

Here's firstName, here's lastName.

What else did I do, city?

We pulled them out.

Although I don't like saying we pulled them out

because they're still in there.

But we singled them out into their own variables.

So we didn't change the original object in any way.

But now we have five new variables based upon values

in that object.

So that can be really helpful.

Now sometimes there are values

or there are properties rather

that have a particular name.

For example, let's say born and died.

And I want to extract them or destructure them,

but I also wanna rename them

because here my variable is going to be called

exactly email or firstName or lastName or city or bio.

But let's say that the property,

well, it is called born and died,

and I instead want my variables to be called birth year

and death year I guess.

Death year sounds a bit grim.

I don't know what you would say instead of that.

But let's just go with birth year to start.

So I could extract it, born equals user,

and that gives me the variable called born.

But if I wanna rename that, I can do this.

Add a colon and then my name, birthYear.

So this will make me a variable called birthYear, not born.

But it will be using user.born.

So the born property,

extract that from user into a variable called birthYear.

And if I refresh, there is no born variable

and there is a birth year.

All right, so I can do the same thing with death.

Say death, or what did we say, died,

I'm gonna rename to deathYear.

And there it is, birthYear and deathYear.

And the last thing I'll mention

is that we can add default values.

So let's say that I have another user.

Here's my second user, user2,

and she has fewer properties.

Her name is Stacy Gonzalez,

and she doesn't have things like a died property

because let's say she's still alive.

And she's not a famous figure,

so she doesn't have a bio.

And what else?

She doesn't have a password.

That was just because I was lazy

and wanted to keep this shorter.

So if I was to destructure from user2,

and let's say I don't know what that looks like,

so I'll go with const {} = and I could pull out...

What do we wanna use here?

Let's go with...

I'm gonna comment these out

just so we don't get conflicts.

I'll go with city and state.

And then if I wanted to go with died,

which does not exist,

and I set that equal to user2,

let's see what we get.

What does died equal?

It's set to undefined.

It just is not found in there.

It's the same as if I had done this.

Const, let's just make something up

like silly = user2.silly.

Well, that makes me a variable that's set to undefined

'cause that's just not a value, it's undefined.

No error.

But if I wanna give a default value,

I can do this with an equal sign.

So if she hasn't died, what should I put here?

Maybe N/A.

And now that default value will be used.

But if I did the same thing for our Harvey Milk example,

and I give it a default value N/A,

you'll see that that is not used.

What did we call it, deathYear?

1978 is used because there is a value found for died

in that object,

and there's not one found in user2.

So we can pull out individual properties,

single them out into variables using the same name,

or we can assign a new name using colon

and then our new variable name.

And we can assign a fallback

or default value using an equal sign.

So that is destructuring from objects.
