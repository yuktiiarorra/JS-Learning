    -: So, next step we move on to our second

type of loop. The while loop.

-: So, a while loop is actually much simpler

than a for loop to understand.

There's just one piece of syntax.

While and then instead of parentheses

a single condition.

And as long as that condition is true,

whatever it is, if it evaluates to true,

your loop will continue to run.

If this ever evaluates to false,

the loop is done. So this is a simple

example, basically recreating what we've

already done with a for loop.

Printing numbers from 0 to 10.

So let's try that out, I'm in a new file

once again just to keep things separate.

We have our for loops video, our files.

And then while loops here, and I've got an

app js. Let's loop starting at 0.

So let's, we could do 'I', we could do count

equals 0. And then

while count is

greater than

let's go with less than 10. And then my curly

braces. And whatever code goes in here will

be run each time through the loop.

But with while loops it's very easy to make

an infinite loop if you're not paying attention.

Because count to 0, count less than 10,

that's always going to be true and there's no

part of the syntax where I actually add or

subtract or alter count in any way in the

loop statement. Instead I do that down in

the body here between the curly braces.

So I need to make sure I'm doing something

like count plus equals 1 or count plus plus

I do that separately. So let's do a console.log

count. And just see what we get.

Okay, so there's 0 through 9 and that

just happened because of where

I'm console.logging.

I'm incrementing count after I print

so I could do it the other way around and

now we should end up with 1 through 10.

Just like that. So this is just another form

of what we've already done right,

the equivalent here is for and I'll use

'I', equals 0 or 1.

'I' less than

10 or less or equal to 10,

'I' plus plus, it's the same idea,

we have some initial value. While some part

is true, some condition is true.

Do this and add 1 to 'I' or to count.

So this is not where most people use a while

loop, I mean you can, but generally for loops

are preferred for things like this where

we have a set number of iterations, it's

always 0 to 10. Or if we have an array, whatever

the length of that array is we're always going

to iterate end times if the array is

twenty items or a thousand items.

That is kind of set in stone.

Where a while loop is more useful in my opinion,

is when we have something that is truly variable

we may not know how many times it iterates.

And that could involve user inputs,

that could be something like a game loop

where we have a board game like

chess or checkers. We want to continue looping

as long as nobody has won the game.

So we could write something like while

and then you know,

game is not over,

or game

over is

not true.

And then in here

we would have you know player one move

and then player two move. And then after this

loop, we would have something like congrats,

because if you made it to this point,

somebody won the game. So game loops are

very common. And it's very hard to know,

it's impossible to know, how many

times you'll need to iterate for a game

of chess or checkers. It could be very

very quick if somebody is smart playing against

somebody who's never played before.

Or it could take a very long time.

Uh, and we're not setting any sort of

defined number of iterations. So I'll show

you a simple example of this sort of while

loop. Why don't we ask a user to enter a

password. So our secret code, let's just

make our secret code here, const secret code,

eh I'll just do secret. Uh, is going

to be how about 'Baby

Hippo',

one word,

camel case like that. Okay, so what I'm

going to do now is have a while loop

where I ask you, to enter, I ask a user

to enter the secret code. And as long as

you don't get it right, so as long as it's

not a match, I'm just gonna keep asking

you over and over and over. So I'm

gonna come up with a variable, let

let's just go with guess equal prompt,

enter the secret code... Okay?

And then while your guess is not equal to

secret, I'm just gonna say guess is equal to the

exact same thing. Prompt enter the secret code.

And that's gonna happen over and over and over

until you get it exactly right, because at that

point, this line inside of the parentheses

will evaluate to false and our loop

will be done. So if I put something

else down here like congrats,

congrats,

you got the secret

That's only going to run after this loop

finishes. And that means it's

only going to run after you enter

BabyHippo correctly. So let's see

what happens. Enter the secret code,

I'll enter something wrong. Nope.

Enter the secret code. Okay, how about

baby? No? Now, I'll enter it correctly.

We are not ignoring case so I have to match

it exactly. BabyHippo. Congrats, you

got the secret. So a while loop works

here because I don't know how many times

this could take, it could be the first

try or somebody might never get it

and we're just going on and on and on and on

hundreds of thousands or more

different times. So there's not a set number of

iterations. And this is where a while loop

really shines. Um, it's just easier to make a

loop like this that runs an unknown number of

times using a while loop. It's nice and

short here, while guess is not equal to secret.

So while the guess is wrong, get a new guess.

And we could print something out if we wanted

to, uh, but I don't think we need to do that

we'll just keep it simple like I have right

here. In the next video I'll show you another

example of this sort of loop,

where it's not really a game loop but it's

kind of the same idea, while you have

not won the game, while you have not

guessed correctly. Uh, that sort of thing,

continue this loop. So that's coming up.
