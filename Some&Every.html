    <!-- Instructor: The next two that we'll look at

are kind of a pair, every and some.

I usually would say some and every.

I don't why I put every first.

Both of them are very similar.

They are Boolean methods, meaning they return true or false.

So unlike map or filter, which return a new array,

these two always return true or false.

And they are ways to test if every element in an array

passes some test,

that's what every does.

We pass in a function,

and if every element when passed into

that function returns true,

then the entire every function call returns true.

So for example, here I've got a bunch of exam scores

and let's see if I want, I wanna know if everybody passed

and let's say our passing score is 75.

So I could do this, exams.every,

and then I pass in a function.

And every element in here, well that's confusing.

Each element in here will be passed into that callback.

And this callback is supposed

to return true or false itself.

So I could do something like score,

score greater than or equal to 75.

Okay, so each one, like 80 will be passed in,

and that should return, in this case, true.

That's true. 80 is greater than or equal to 75.

All of these should return true,

and because of that, every will return true.

So let's try it out. We get true.

But now as soon as I change one of these scores to go below,

let's say this is 70, and I run this again,

now we get false.

So as soon as one of them returns false from this callback,

the entire every is false.

Now we also have some which is very similar

the way that it works,

except that it's going to test if any of the elements

or if some of the elements pass the test.

So it doesn't care, like every does,

where every single thing has to return true

from that callback.

With some, it's only one or more.

So if I used some here instead,

we're just seeing is there any score,

is there at least one score that is greater than 75?

And of course there is, whoops, I didn't copy that

and I'm not printing it.

So we get true.

So instead of doing that,

why don't we go with our movies example down here

and why don't we see if there are,

I don't know, if there's any movie created

after the year 2015.

So movies.some and then our callback.

So for a movie,

we wanna see if a movie.year is greater than, what'd we say,

2015 or something.

Let's see. Is there at least one? Yes, there is.

So it doesn't tell us which one, right?

We could use filter if we wanted to make a new array,

only containing those movies.

All that we're saying is take this call back

and tell me if it returns true at least once

when you pass in each element from the array.

And it does because one of them at least,

"Parasite" is 2019.

And you know, if I had changed that instead to be 2010,

all of a sudden this whole thing returns false.

There's not one element where this callback is true

or where it returns true.

So some and every go with one another.

Hopefully relatively straightforward.

They both are Booleans, they return true or false.

And the function you need to write,

the callback that you pass in

should return true or false as well.
