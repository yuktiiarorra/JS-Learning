    <!-- Instructor: So the first of these fancy array methods

that accepts a function as its argument is called forEach.

Now forEach actually used to be a lot more commonly used

before the advent of the for of loop.

Basically what it does is it allows us to run a function,

run some code once per item in some array.

So whatever function we pass in,

that function will be called once per item

where each item will be passed

into the function automatically.

So I've got an array here, it's called numbers.

It's very simple, just a bunch of numbers.

And if I wanted to print out each number,

I could use forEach, numbers.forEach like this.

And then it expects us to pass in a callback.

So we could define this function separately,

like function print.

It just accepts some elements

and then it console.logs

that elements just like that.

So I can call print myself, you know, I could do this print

of numbers zero, right?

And print numbers one and so on.

And hopefully we see both of those printed out

and we do, we see one and two, right?

The first and second elements.

Now I'm not going to do that.

I'm gonna use forEach,

and forEach is going to do it for me.

So I'll just pass in the function I want it to call

for each element.

So it will execute print once per element.

And it's not just doing it one time per element,

but it's passing in the element.

So it will pass one to print, two to print, three to print.

So let's try it.

And there we go.

We get every element printed out.

So nothing crazy there,

but this is pretty uncommon to do forEach

and just pass in a function that you've already defined.

What we most commonly see

is defining a function in line here.

We've seen this before, an anonymous function expression,

like this right here.

We need to come up with our parameter name,

let's just call this el.

And then inside those curly braces console.log el.

So this is incredibly common,

this format, this pattern here.

Something like forEach

we could pass in a named function we've already created,

but most of the time we'll just pass in a function

that exists solely for this moment in time.

So it's not something we plan on calling again.

So let's just verify this works

and it does, we get the same outcome.

So it seems kind of silly,

especially for something like forEach

because we know how to print out each element now

using a for of, just as an example,

for let element of numbers

console.log el, and that's easier to read, right?

It's shorter and it doesn't have to involve functions,

which is nice, but this has not always been a thing,

this is newer.

So forEach for a long time was people's first choice

for printing out, well, not for printing out,

but for doing something once per element in some array.

So instead of just printing things, right,

we can do something a little bit more complicated.

Let's print out the even numbers.

So if, and then el, mod two,

that's how we tell if something is even.

If it's cleanly divisible by two.

If that's the case,

we will console.log the element.

Refresh.

Now we only see 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on.

Alright, so that's one example of forEach.

Let's do another one though.

I have a more slightly complicated example here

or data structure.

A movie's array and it contains objects.

So each movie is an object with a title and a score.

What I'd like to do is print out something like, you know,

maybe just the movie.

So let's say Alien

and then 90 out of 100 will be at score.

Okay?

So I wanna do 90/100 or 95/100.

So I'm gonna call a function once per element in this array.

So movies.forEach.

And as we talked about,

most commonly we use an anonymous function expression

that exists just for this purpose.

And then we need to come up with our parameter here.

What do we want to call this?

Let's call it movie.

So movie is going to be each element

one at a time from this array.

It will be passed in automatically to this function.

So I'm simply providing a function to forEach

and I'm saying hello forEach

here's a function I would like you to call.

We're not executing this function, right?

We're just defining it.

If we wrote this out here, I mean technically it needs

to be saved in a variable const f.

This defines a function, but it never executes it.

I still would have to use parentheses to execute it.

So we're not calling this, we are just writing it.

So forEach movie we'll do something simple, console.log,

and if we just print out movie,

it will just be the entire object.

Each element is an object.

So I wanted to print out a string that had the movie title

and the movie rating.

So I'll do something like this

with a string template literal.

We'll do the movie title, movie.title -

and then another dollar sign, curly brace, movie.score.

And then I wanted to do it out of 100.

So here we go.

And that's kind of it.

So forEach these days, not actually used very often

because we do have access to for of, but it's our first

and simplest example of these array callback methods,

these methods that expect a function to be passed in.

So I want to start here.

Next up we're gonna talk about one called map.
