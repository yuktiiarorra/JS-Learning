    <!-- TUESDAY
    I DON'T KNOW THAT!
    WEEKEND 
    weekend.

And then if I set it to something else,

we don't have a case that matches that,

we get I don't know that.

So that is a basic intro to the switch statement.

Again, I can't emphasize this enough,

don't worry about this right now.

I had to put this somewhere in the course.

I figured I should group it with the rest

of the conditional logic, but I'd say one out of every 50

or maybe one out of every 100 conditional statements

that I write, I'm using the switch statement pretty much

every other time I'm gonna be using if else, if and else,

you can see, you know,

this could shorten things up significantly

or if you had a bunch of things that you were trying

to check, a bunch of different cases, this can be nice,

but a lot of the time just the logic we're trying

to do doesn't fit this situation all that well.

So that is a switch statement, switch parentheses,

curly braces, and then cases with a colon.

I think that's what throws a lot of people off.

And I'll stop here.

Okay, so it's in the course now, not my favorite.

I don't mean to trash talk it,

but you just won't see it all that frequently.

You will see it at least one time,

I think exactly one time in this course,

which is why I added this video in.

But I'll shut up for now. Okay.
