    Speaker: Okie dokie.

It's finally time to run our code, our JavaScript code

that is from a separate file that we can save and revisit.

Typing our code in the console is great for, you know,

one-off things.

We're just quickly testing what is one plus three?

Great.

We don't need to make a file and save a script

and execute that script in the browser.

Let's just do it in the console.

But if we wanna write more than one line at a time, I mean,

technically you can do multiple lines.

If you hit shift enter, you can type multiple lines there.

But still the point remains that as soon as I do hit enter,

or I close this Window and come back,

or my computer dies, you know, I thought

that charger was plugged in and it wasn't.

It happens to me all the time.

My code is gone, right?

This is not permanent in any way

and most websites, most applications are gonna consist

of hundreds if not thousands of lines of JavaScript.

So this is really not where we wanna write real code.

It's a great place to test things out.

It's a great place to debug your code

to figure out what's going wrong,

but it's not a real editor.

That's why we have VS code.

So to run a JavaScript file, what we have

to do is make a JavaScript file so we can start there.

I'm in a new folder here, I'm calling it Running_Js_Script.

And the only requirement here is that our file ends in .js.

So why don't we go with script.js or app,

I like app.js, but whatever works, notice VS code

gives me the little JavaScript logo, the icon.

Yours might look different.

So in here, we can put some code,

like, you know, one plus three.

But remember, this is not gonna show up anywhere

unless I print it out.

So we'll do a console.log as we just learned.

"Hello from our first file,

our first JS file", okay?

Now I'm gonna save this file.

Now in my index.html, I need to connect this script

with the HTML file.

So I can't just open this in the browser unfortunately,

to connect it, what I need to do is use a script element.

So in HTML, we have a script element.

It does kind of what I've already said.

So the script element accepts an attribute called source,

src, just like we have on a image.

And this source needs to be the path to a script.

So app.js, just like that.

Okay?

And then I can open this in the browser.

So I'm just gonna give this a new title.

First JS Script.

I'll open this in the browser,

like we've opened everything else.

I mean, I can put an h1 or something in here if I want,

but we're not gonna be working with the HTML.

We're simply using this HTML document as like a vessel

to carry our script.

It's just a conduit so that we can actually run our script,

but our script won't be interacting with the elements.

Not yet at least.

So, I've got my h1 First Script.

Now, I'm gonna open this up.

Here it is in all its glory, a beautiful webpage,

and I'm gonna open the console.

And there we go. So, it's up to you

how you wanna manage this,

if you want this to be collapsed

as a drawer in the actual browser webpage,

but since we're not interacting with this content,

I usually just pop it out like we've been doing.

This is now where we'll go

to see the result of our code running.

So I just want to emphasize this one more time

if I wasn't clear enough.

Doing something like one plus three, that is going to run,

but we won't see any output.

I'm refreshing the page here, which is what we need to do

anytime I change my file, just like an HTML

or CSS file, if I change this, I need to save

and then rerun it in the browser or just refresh.

So I don't see that, even though,

it actually did execute, it's just not there.

Now what I could do is make a variable,

let total equal one plus three, and then refresh over here.

I still don't see it, but I do have access

to those variables I've declared over in my script, assuming

that the page is open.

So it's not like every browser Window ever

will have access to total.

It's just in this file that I've made right now.

So I can put multiple console.logs in here,

of course, console.log, hello from a file, console.log,

goodbye, refresh.

And now we get both of them.

The other thing I wanna make clear upfront, you'll learn,

or we hopefully will learn together as we progress

through JavaScript, that this is actually not

the ideal placement.

It's not the ideal place to put a JavaScript script

in our document.

Usually, we put these down at the very end of our body.

Now it's not gonna make a single,

I was gonna say a wink of difference.

I don't know if that's a real expression,

an iota of difference.

It's not gonna matter right now

because the reason we do this has to do

with when we're writing JavaScript that interacts

with HTML elements.

Like if I wanted to have a button in here

and I could click it and it would run some JavaScript code,

I want those elements to be loaded.

I want them to be acknowledged by the browser

before my script.

But right now, we're not doing it.

So it really won't matter or doesn't matter right now,

but it's a good habit to get into.

You can add your scripts at the bottom of the body, not

outside it, but at the end of the body.

And I think that's pretty much it.

So make a file with .js as the extension.

Put your code in there.

We'll be doing this all the time.

Connect it to your HTML document with script,

the script element with the source attribute.

Make sure that path is correct.

File name matches, you know,

if you have something like js/, if it's in a folder.

And then open that file in your browser.

I have it open right here.

And then open up the dev tools

and our console will print out, well,

it will show us whatever we've printed out

from our JavaScript file.

Okay, so that's the recipe to follow.
