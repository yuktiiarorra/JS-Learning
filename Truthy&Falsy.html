     Instructor: All right, quick little topic here,

but an important one.

We need to talk about truthiness

and faultiness, or just truthy

and falsely values or inherent truthiness and falseness.

I don't know how to even spell truthiness

and falseness, honestly, it doesn't matter.

I don't think they're official terms,

but most people recognize them.

Anyway, let's talk about what they mean.

Every value in JavaScript,

every single one, has an inherent truthiness

and falseness that obviously does not mean

they are true and they are false.

There's only two values that are actually true and false.

We know them, exactly true and exactly false,

but every value,

whether it's the string alksjd

or the number 98 or the value null,

they all have an inherent truthiness or falseness to them.

They all have either a light side or dark side

or good or evil, or just true and false, right?

And we don't need to assign inherent moral to them either.

It's just are they truthy or falsey.

Now, this matters for a couple of reasons

we'll see as we make more progress,

but let me just lay out the rules.

Every single value in JavaScript

is considered truthy except for the following.

False, okay, that one makes sense.

It should be falsey,

zero, empty string, null,

undefined, and not a number or NaN.

Everything else is truthy.

So let me show you what this looks like

or how we could see this in practice.

I have a new script, a new HTML document,

and I'm gonna do something.

Right here, I'm going to prompt a user, Enter something,

save that to a variable,

constInput or userInput or something like that.

Okay?

Now, if a user enters nothing,

if it just pops up right away, refreshing, here it is,

enter something and I just hit Enter right away,

the value of userInput, if I look at it,

it's an empty string and we've seen

that empty strings are inherently falsey.

So I can do this right here.

If userInput and I don't have to compare it to anything.

I can literally just say if there is a userInput,

because if it's any string

other than an empty string, that will be truthy.

So console.log, truthy,

otherwise, console.log falsey.

Okay, so I'm gonna try this.

I'm gonna type something, anything, a string.

Truthy.

All we wrote was if userInput.

I didn't say if it equals something,

if it's greater than something,

I just said if userInput.

So we know userInput is not true or false,

the actual value true or false,

but it's going to be coerced into a Boolean,

into its truthiness or inherent faultiness.

It will be revealed.

So if it's a string that has anything in it,

it's truthy and see, console.log truthy.

But if I just hit Enter right away, no text, we get falsey.

This tells us, well, it doesn't really tell us anything

because we already knew this,

but it shows that an empty string is considered falsey.

So I'll show you a few more examples.

We can do something like if false,

well, we know what happens with if false,

but if we do if zero, console.log

zero, let's just do truthy there.

Else, console.log falsey.

And we should see falsey

because zero itself is considered falsey.

So if we do if zero, it's like doing if false.

That's just not going to be true.

And the same goes for some of the other values we've seen.

For example, null, falsey.

If I have any other number, by the way, I didn't show that,

but they're truthy.

Even a negative number, negative one, truthy.

It's just zero, and not a number.

So let's try not a number, falsey.

And the last one we have after null,

we've gotta do undefined,

which is inherently falsey as well.

So anything else, a string, a number,

what else do we have?

The Boolean true.

Any number, any string that is not empty,

even if it's just a space, that's truthy.

The falsey here is because I didn't comment this one out.

Okay, so this is something

we can take advantage of often

in a situation like this right here,

where we have some variable,

some input or something that's coming from somewhere else.

And we're going to check

just if it exists or if there's a value

inside of that string,

or if it's an empty string or if a value has been defined.

If a variable actually has data in it

and it's not undefined or it's not null,

I can simply write if userInput.

I don't need to do if it equals or if it's not equal

to an empty string, I can simply do,

if it's inherently truthy, do that.

Otherwise, do that.

And this will come into play

in a little bit because next up,

we're gonna learn more about logical operators

and combining pieces of logic.

And often, this inherent truthiness

and falsiness will come into play.
