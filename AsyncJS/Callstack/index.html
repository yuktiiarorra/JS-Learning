    <!-- So I'm going to actually get rid of this breakpoint and refresh the page so we go back to normal.

But if I was ever confused about something, at some point in my code, I can put a breakpoint, I can

pause, and then I can actually play around with values in the console.

But for now, I really want to just use this as a demo for the call stack.

Debugging is a separate topic, alrighty

So the call stack is not a physical thing we look at.

I mean, there's it's underlying all of our code.

It's a structure tool that helps JavaScript keep its place in our code and our function calls.

But, you know, this is just a representation.

It's just a tool for us to view it just like this is here or just like my lovely slides are.

All right.

So that's the concept of the call stack.
