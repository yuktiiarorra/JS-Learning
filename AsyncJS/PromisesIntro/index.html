    <!-- Instructor: All right, so now we get to promises,

kind of.

This is gonna be a multi-step introduction.

Let's begin with the overarching idea.

Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion

or let's say eventual success

or failure of some operation, some async operation.

So the most common example

and the one that we'll be working with a lot

is making a request,

getting data from some other location,

getting data from a movies like IMDB API

or from Netflix's API

or getting information from what else is there?

Amazon's API, Goodreads API, the weather API,

whatever it is.

We haven't actually seen how we do that,

but we've talked about how it takes time

and sometimes it works and sometimes it won't.

Maybe you don't have the right credentials

or the URL is incorrect.

Maybe you know the API's down or your internet's down.

There's a whole bunch of things that could go wrong.

So what I'm gonna do, if you download the code,

there's a folder called Promisesintro.

And there are two functions in here I've already written

and we're not gonna touch them at all.

I'm just gonna show you how they work,

or rather how we work with them.

So I mentioned in the previous video

that a really common pattern

for things like making requests,

at least in the past would be something like this,

make, you know, request.

And then we would pass in two callbacks,

the success callback.

So we could have our first callback.

And then a second callback, only one of which

is going to run, which often we would call our failure

or fail callback.

So makeRequest would be some function implemented

that basically checks, all right, did this request work?

Then call this function.

If it didn't work, call this function.

So we end up with two callbacks per request.

And then if I wanna do something

after in the success, I end up nesting again

and again, right?

I get this very nasty looking thing.

And that's actually what I've written here.

I've written a function called fakeRequestCallback.

So it's not making a real request,

we're not loading real data,

but what it wants you to do is pass in a URL.

So I'm just gonna try it here,

fakeRequestCallback, I'm gonna pass in a fake URL

or a real one, it doesn't matter.

But let's just say books.com, okay?

And then I have to pass in two callbacks,

success and failure.

And only one of these is going to run

and it's all based upon a random number.

So I'm picking a delay from 500 milliseconds to 5,000

or to five seconds.

And if that delay is greater than four seconds,

I'm going to call the failure callback.

So it's all based upon the order, right?

Success is the first callback, failure is the second.

So if it takes more than four seconds,

we'll get a connection timeout.

Otherwise we'll call success, which is just the name

for the first callback.

So we can pass in two callbacks.

Again, here's the first one, this would be our success.

Let's do console.log, "IT WORKED!!!!"

And then our second callback, a second argument here,

another function, console.log "ERROR!!!"

All right, so let's just see what happens. I'll run it.

We wait and we get "IT WORKED!!!!" Let's try it again.

It worked, and eventually, nope, still it worked.

Eventually we'll get the error. Come on.

There it is.

It only took me like 10 more tries.

Okay, so we see error.

All right, so imagine this is real.

This is not random number basis,

it's an actual real request we're making

and that will help us understand why we would do this.

It's a little trivial when we, you know,

completely manufacture this random number thing.

But if I introduce real requests right now,

there's just a lot to talk about.

The nature of requests and get versus posts and status codes

and the response bot.

There's just a lot of additional baggage

that we have to cover.

So we're starting with our fake requests.

Anyway, if you notice, these callbacks are called,

I execute them,

but I'm also passing information in.

So this is a really common pattern as well.

And we've seen it before.

If we do something like, imagine there's an array

called array or arr,

when we map over it, we pass in a function, right?

And this function has a parameter we define, like,

we'll call it elements,

and element is filled, it's actually passed, right?

Map is automatically gonna pass a value to this callback.

Same idea here.

My callbacks, if I look at how this function works,

or if I didn't write this function,

if I looked at the documentation,

I would see that there's going to be a failure message

passed to the failure callback.

And then there's a success message passed

to the success callback.

In this case, they're just strings.

But if I wanted to work with them, also,

you'll see people do this as well where you indent.

So this is success.

The first one, we'll call this data

or response, console.log, "IT WORKED!!!!"

And then we'll console.log the response.

And then here we can call this error

and we'll just console.log the error here.

All right?

So nothing really different except now,

all right, we see "IT WORKED!!!!"

And "Here is your fake data from books.com."

That is what was passed to this callback right there.

Here's your fake data.

Okay, so now let's say I wanna make another request

only if books.com works.

Let's say I'm doing books.com/page1.

So if we got page one,

I also wanna make a request to page two.

So I need to do another fake request

and then books.com/page2.

And then I have to have my two callbacks.

I have my success callback. Here's our response.

Let's just do that right there.

"IT WORKED AGAIN!!!!"

And we'll print the response.

Otherwise we have our second callback

where we have an error.

'Cause this second one could go wrong.

The first one might have worked,

but the second one could go wrong.

So we'll print error here, we'll do "ERROR (2nd req)!!!"

Just so we can tell what's what.

Okay, and already this is pretty nested

and obnoxious, but let's take a look.

Does the first one work? Hmm.

Okay, so our first request came back

and then our second request came back.

So in order for us to wait to only make that second request

after the first one finished

and was successful, we have to nest it inside

of this success callback, right?

It's like a branching path.

Success, fail,

but then inside of success can make another one.

And we have success and fail.

And I'll make one more, which is,

it's definitely a thing in the real world

where we might have three requests, I wanna make one

after another, but in a chain, sort of a series.

Only if each one worked.

So if one of them at any point fails, I wanna stop,

which is what we're doing here.

So inside of here, one more fake request

and then I'll put my books.com/page3.

And then my first callback, right?

And this one, we'll do the same thing.

I'll just console.log it worked again,

let's do third request,

and then our error callback.

And this whole thing just gets hideous.

And this is exactly what people are referring to

when they say callback hell,

It's just a nightmare to try and, you know,

figure out, "All right, if I need

to change the second request, fail callback."

I mean, it's not that hard to figure it out,

but it's just not immediately obvious.

And then keeping things indented properly

and you know, associating, "All right,

these two are connected to success, fail, success, fail."

It just gets overwhelming. But let's update this.

So this would be an error for the third request.

Now we'll make our first one, if it works,

we make the second one.

If that one works, we make the third.

If at any point it does not work,

all right, good so far,

and oh, timed out and now we're done.

We didn't make that next request

because we didn't run that success callback,

but one of these times we'll get all three

just sitting here waiting.

Oh, first one failed.

So again, this is mimicking

something in the real world, right?

This function I wrote is completely fake and silly.

But this is something that is real

where a request may not work.

Hopefully it has a much better success rate

than ours right here.

Okay, two for two.

Hey, there we go. We get all three.

Okay, so this is the callback approach,

and this is how we would do things

for a very long time, when making requests,

we would have our success and our fail callback.

And then if we needed a nested request,

it was the same thing, two callbacks per request,

over and over and over.

And it wasn't limited to just making requests,

but that's a really common use.

And again, we haven't seen real requests.

So this is all silly and fake for the moment.

Anyway, then along came promises.

People got very frustrated with this experience,

as you can probably imagine, it's just annoying.

Look at this code, it's scary, it's ugly.

So promises came along

and they promised a future

where we could have asynchronous code,

where we didn't need to have all these nested,

crazy callbacks,

but we could still have the exact same logic

or the same flow where, you know,

we only make this second request if the first one works.

We only make the third one if the second one works.

And then at any point, if there's an error,

we'll print out the error or we'll do something.

We handle the error.

So promises still allow us to have that branching path,

do this, and then do this, and then do that.

But it looks a lot, lot nicer,

it's a lot easier to understand.

There's just a bit of syntax we have to cover.

So in the next video we'll see how we work with promises.

Instructor: Okay, I kind of cheated you

in the last video.

I said we were gonna talk about Promises,

but I still kind of just set up the idea of Promises,

but now we're actually gonna see the syntax.

So we saw this horrible callback hell situation

where we have a success and a failure callback.

Everything's nested, it's hideous.

And I said, Promises make it better.

Or they can.

Remember, Promises have not been around

since the dawn of JavaScript.

If we just go to MDN and we take a look about,

or we take a look at the Promise page, you'll see

that there's not support in Internet Explorer.

But these days, IE support is not necessarily mandatory,

depending on what you're working on.

Anyway, Promises are new.

That's the first thing I want you to understand.

Second, there's a bit of syntax involved in Promises,

and we're gonna go through it step-by-step.

And you might feel lost

or you might feel confused at some point.

If this is all new to you, this has been a whirlwind

of asynchronous JavaScript and we're going quickly.

I recognize that,

and this is even in person when I'm teaching this

and we have, you know, multiple TAs and exercises

and office hours and students study together,

it's still one of those topics

that just some people have a rough time with.

So don't feel bad about that.

If you do, I'll point out the stuff that's really essential

and then the stuff that's, mm, good to know,

but not mandatory in any way.

Okay.

So a Promise is just an object.

It's a promise of an eventual value

that may or may not work out.

I like to use the explanation

or the analogy of a promise in the real world.

When I was a kid, let's say I really wanted to get candy.

My parents would never let me have candy,

and now I have a massive sweet tooth.

It's horrible.

I wish I was allowed to have more.

Maybe I could have some self-control

as an adult, but I don't.

So as a kid, I would beg to go

to the candy store anytime we were near the candy store

in the food court where I lived

or not, where I lived, near where I lived.

And I would ask and say, "Can I please have candy?"

And I would be promised, if you are a good boy

and you eat all of your dinner

and you eat all your vegetables, then you can have candy.

Now, that is not the same

as me having candy right then, right?

It's not the same as just handing me candy when I wanted it.

It's a promise for the eventual,

hopefully resolution of me getting candy.

But also, I might not eat my vegetables.

Most of the time I had a pretty rough time with that.

I might fake eating the vegetables,

put 'em in a napkin under the table,

wait until we go by the trash can, throw it away.

Sometimes that worked.

Long story short, a Promise is the eventual guarantee

of either a value or an error.

It's the eventual resolution of something good or bad,

but it's not the same as having that value.

So if I've written a function in here

called fakeRequestPromise, it does the exact same thing

as this callback version,

except it does not involve callbacks.

We're not gonna talk about the syntax here just yet.

We're just gonna use this.

We'll be on the the other side of calling this function.

We're not gonna write it.

But if you notice something,

it only expects you to pass in a URL.

It does not expect a success in a failure callback.

It doesn't expect callbacks at all to be passed in.

So if we just call it,

I'm just gonna comment out our callback hell,

if I call it over here, fakeRequestPromise,

what you'll see, I can pass in any URL here.

It doesn't matter.

What we get back, the return value,

is this thing called a Promise.

Now, if I save that to a variable,

I don't know if you could see that,

but at the very beginning it says "pending"

and then it's not gonna update here.

But if I open it up, it actually says "resolved".

So I'm gonna save that to a variable, fakeRequest,

lemme just hit the up arrow,

fakeRequestPromise.

Let's say I'm going to, I don't know,

hikingtrails.com/api/nearme.

Okay, I'm gonna save that to a variable.

I'm just gonna call it res.

If we look at res, it says "pending",

and I look at res again, now it says "resolved".

So it's this object that just represents at the beginning,

the eventual value.

It doesn't have anything.

It just says them.

There's going to be something here.

And then in this case it was resolved,

but I could make another one.

If I just redo this,

oh, I shouldn't have used const.

Let's do response

and I'll use let.

All right, so if we look at response here,

is it still pending?

Yeah.

Oh, there we go.

Now it says "Connection Timeout".

If we look at our Promise, which we got back,

rejected.

So those terms resolved and rejected

represent basically success and failure.

It's just the terms that are used, resolved and rejected.

So this Promise can have three states.

It can be pending, like it is at the beginning

while we're waiting for something, right?

Promises represent this asynchronous value

that eventually will be resolved or rejected.

But at the beginning, that might be almost instantaneous,

but it could be about an hour that it's just pending.

I don't think I've ever done anything like that,

but it could be.

So it's pending and then eventually resolved or rejected.

Now, what I can do,

and the whole point of Promises is that I can run code

when the Promise is rejected or when it's resolved.

And the way that we do this is by attaching callbacks

to the object, to the Promise itself.

Rather than passing callbacks into a function, we wait

for the function to return a Promise object,

like it has here, right?

Every time I call this,

I get this object, which is a Promise

if I can spell it correctly

and I can attach methods,

or I can attach callbacks to it,

that will run depending on whether the Promise

was rejected or resolved.

So here's how it works.

I've got this fakeRequestPromise.

It's the same thing we just called in the console.

I need to pass in my url.

Let's do what else?

See yelp.com/api/coffee.

All right, let's pretend that gives us some real results.

It doesn't.

I save that to a variable.

If I want const,

and I could call this, I'll just call it Promise or request.

Sure.

So this gives me an object.

And then if I wanna run code, if this is resolved,

if the Promise is resolved, I do this,

request., and then this is the important part, .then

and I pass a callback in here.

So I'll just do an arrow function

and I'll console.log.

It worked.

Okay?

So, let's just see if we get that.

Hey, we did.

So that tells us the Promise was resolved.

If I look at, or no, what did I call it?

Request.

If I look at that, it says resolved in here.

Okay?

Now eventually, and I could do this again,

that one worked too,

but eventually we'll see that

we'll get one that was not resolved.

Here we go.

We got a Connection Timeout.

Again, fake, but that's how I've written this function

to return a Promise that sometimes is rejected.

And if we look at it, request,

it says "rejected".

So I can also run code when the Promise is rejected

or if it's rejected.

And to do that, there is a method called .catch,

and I can pass a callback into that

and I can console.log.

Oh, no.

Error.

Okay?

And often what you'll see is people space these out

or they put them on the next line like this

so it's just a little bit flatter looking.

Okay, there we go.

So, this is an object.

There's a method on it, .then.

There's another one, .catch.

We pass a callback into both of them.

Only one will run.

If the Promise is resolved, this function runs.

If it's rejected, this function runs.

So I'll even make that clearer,

console.log ("PROMISE RESOLVED!")

And then here, ("PROMISE REJECTED!")

All right.

So we wait.

Hey, it worked.

That was a quick one.

Promise resolved, it worked.

Next up.

Ah, I'm trying to get a rejection.

Come on.

Nope.

Nope.

Oh.

Yes, there we go.

Promise rejected.

Oh, no error.

So I could make a second request, right?

If I mimic what we did before,

let's do coffee/page1

and then I'll do the same thing for page 2.

First I'll show you though that you really don't need

to save this to a variable.

What a lot of people do is just chain it like this,

just like that,

fakeRequestPromise.

This returns an object, a Promise object,

and we chain our .then and our .catch.

Then, in the .then, in this callback,

that means it worked.

I can make another one, right?

Page 2.

And then I need to add my own .then.

So we'll just do two levels to start.

Okay.

So in my .then, what do I wanna do?

I'm gonna do a ("PROMISE RESOLVED!")

It worked, but I'm gonna say,

(2), just so we can see there's a difference.

Alrighty.

So this may not seem a lot better

than what we've seen so far,

but I promise it will be cleaned up.

Right, this is still nested.

We're nesting more.

Here we have our .then.

Let's just see what happens though.

So the first one worked

and then the second one worked.

Good news, right?

So we made one and then the other.

But what if this second one doesn't work?

Well, I can have a .catch here as well

and I'll just copy this and I just duplicate that.

Okay?

So we have our .catch for the second request,

this fake request, and let's see what we get now.

It worked.

Oh, and it didn't work that second time.

So our .catch, this callback, ran.

So I'm gonna clean things up just a tiny bit.

We won't say ("PROMISE RESOLVED!") every time now.

Let's just say it worked.

And then I'll put request,

or how about (page1) here?

And then I'll duplicate this

and say (page2) here.

What did I do there?

Just so we can tell where things are going wrong.

And then I'll do ERROR!!! (page2)

so we know versus ERROR!!! (page1).

And then I'll make a third request.

So the same exact thing after,

and only if the second request works,

which means the first one also worked.

So fakeRequestPromise,

I should just copy that url, fake url,

page 3.

And then I chain on my .then with my callback,

and we'll do "IT WORKED!!!!!! (page3)"

Oof.

This seems like it's not really an improvement at all.

Trust me, it will be.

But I just wanna show the very basics

how we can recreate what we already had.

Okay, so lots of nesting.

How is that any better?

But let's just see that it works.

So we make our first request that return to promise.

If it's resolved, this callback runs.

If it's not, we stop.

It's a dead end.

We get an error.

So then if it is resolved,

we make our second request.

First we print this out, "IT WORKED!!!!!! (page1)".

Then we make our second fake request,

and the same thing repeats.

If it's resolved, this runs.

Otherwise, this runs.

So here we are.

I refreshed the page.

First one.

Oh, we errored out on the very first one.

Let's try it again.

Come on.

IT WORKED!!!!!!

Now, next page.

IT WORKED!!!!!!

And, IT WORKED!!!!!!

All right, so we made it.

We got all three pages of data, which really is nothing.

We didn't get any data.

However, this really doesn't seem like an improvement

at all and it's not.

We just moved the nesting

from inside our function call, right here.

We're passing callbacks in,

into fakeRequestCallback.

This is all nested

between the opening and closing parentheses.

Here, we're not nesting it that way, right?

We're not passing it into fakeRequestPromise.

Instead, we're calling it .then and .catch methods

or method on the returned to Promise object

but that still requires us to nest stuff.

Well, in the next video we'll see the magic Promises

that allows us to actually significantly shorten this

and flatten it a lot.

So that's coming up next.

At this point, it seems like Promises are kind of

maybe a waste of time, but they're not.


Instructor: Now, onto the cool part,

the magical part of promises.

Magical might be a bit strong.

Actually, cool might be a bit strong too.

But the nicer part about promises,

the part where they get better than callbacks,

because at the moment,

this really doesn't look any different.

We still have that same level of nesting.

So here's the secret.

With promises instead of .then,

I can actually return a promise to myself.

So this is a promise here, or it gives me a promise.

If I return that from within .then,

I can chain other .thens on without having to nest them.

So I'll rewrite this.

I'll keep this, I'm gonna make the first bit here.

So here's our first request.

Just comment this out.

And then we're gonna have a .then.

We know that.

So let's just start there.

And inside of this .then, what do I wanna do?

I'll just console.log that same thing again.

And then I'll make my next request, like this, for page two.

This is no different than what we did before,

but what we did before

was that we wrote our .then right here

and we chained it on, well, that's not valid syntax.

There we go.

Inside of there,

we chained it onto this promise,

the object that's returned from this method

or from that function.

But I can instead return this promise

and what that allows me to do is just write my .then here.

I don't need to nest it.

I'm returning a promise here

and I'm calling .then on that returned promise.

So in here I can do the same thing.

I'll print out page two, or it worked for page two,

and then I'll return another promise to do page three.

And then I can do another,

I'm just gonna copy the whole thing, .then, page three

and I won't make another request.

We'll just finish there.

So we still don't have .catches in the picture

but the extra nice part

is that I can use a single .catch for all of these.

So in here, my callback, console.log,

oh no,

a request failed.

So if at any point of these promises is rejected,

it falls through and it hits this .catch.

So this is the same idea as what we had up here.

The one big difference is that I'm actually printing

something different in each .catch.

I'm saying error for page three,

error for page two, error for page one.

Here, we'll always get that same message,

oh no, a request failed.

It doesn't matter really in this example,

but that's something to be aware of.

I can put my own .then and .catches and I can nest things.

But this is far nicer.

It's flat. It's completely flat.

Well, almost completely.

We do have some indentation,

but I could make 10 subsequent or sequential requests.

First this one,

and only if that works, then the second one.

Only if the second one works, then the third one and so on.

And I wouldn't have to go nested 10 levels deep

like I would with callbacks

or with what we saw in the previous video.

But let me shut up and just prove that this works.

So I refresh.

Okay, first one worked.

Second one worked.

Eh, third one worked.

Alright, let's see one where we get a rejected promise.

First one worked.

Second one

worked.

Come on, ugh.

We need one of these to be rejected

so I can prove that the catch works.

Okay, well there's our first .catch.

That was the very first request failed.

First one works.

Second one.

Oh.

There we go. It failed.

So we didn't have a separate .catch for that second request.

It just fell through to this right here.

So again, the trick to all of this

is that we return a promise from within our callback

from within the .then callback.

And that allows us to chain things on.

So run this if the first promise is resolved.

Oh, return a new promise.

So then run this if it's resolved.

And if it is, return this new promise.

Here's our .then for that new promise.

But if at any point that promise is not resolved,

AKA it's rejected, our .catch will run.

Okay?

Now the next thing to know about promises

is that they are resolved and rejected with values.

So right now, our callbacks here,

they don't have any parameters,

but actually a promise can be rejected

and resolved with a value pass to it.

And that's important.

If I was actually making a real request,

we would want the data.

And the way I wrote fake request promise

is that it actually does pass in some data.

It's not real data, it just passes in a string.

So let's use that.

Let's print out the data.

Just like that.

And then I'll just duplicate that for each one of these.

And you'll see that we do get data passed through.

Alright, so let's try it now.

And we should see,

you know, here's your fake data from this page.

Here's your fake data from that page.

So this is coming from the function.

I didn't write that here,

but imagine that this is real data, right?

That's what we're waiting on.

We care if a request worked or didn't work,

but a lot of the time what we want is the information,

the actual data from that request.

Anyway, this whole thing has taken us

into the weeds quite a bit.

But this principle, if the .then is being chained,

as long as you return a promise from within

each .then callback,

that is crucial to working with promises.

That's really the thing that makes it all work.

That makes our code so much cleaner.

I mean, compare this so much easier to just logically read,

do this, and then do this,

and then do this, and then do this.

Compared to this here.

Oof.

Or especially this right here.

I mean, this is a nightmare.

All this functions and nestedness and callbacks.

I mean, I'm not saying that this is a joy to read,

but it's substantially better.

Alright, so also when a promise is rejected,

we can pass a value through when it's rejected.

So in here,

I believe I passed something through

when I wrote this function.

Let's print out that error.

Let's see if we get a rejected promise.

Resolved.

Come on.

Okay, connection timeout.

That was what it was rejected with.

That was the error.

Okay so hopefully you can see how this is nice.

We still haven't written promises ourself, right?

We're working with them.

You probably have taken a peek at this

if you're following along in the file.

Here is the function.

It returns a new promise object.

We'll learn more about how this works.

But really what's crucial is that you understand .then

and .catch and this thing called promise chaining,

where I can have dependent asynchronous actions

where this only happens if this happened

and if this happened, or if they all worked.

And if at any point something went wrong,

this callback runs.

So this is really, really important to understand.

We'll get more practice with it

and soon we'll be making real requests

where you'll see the utility of this.

If you're feeling lost or shaky or confused or afraid,

totally normal.

I promise, this is a big step.

We will actually see another iteration

of improvement upon this syntax

when we talk about async functions.

So try and get familiar with this.

Don't stress too much.

We'll get more practice,

and this is one of those things that you'll use a lot

and eventually it will start to make sense.

So don't feel like you need to rewatch

the last couple videos a million times.

I know they're hard to watch.

They're long.

They're bit dull.

I know.

I recorded them, okay?

I know.

So don't panic.
