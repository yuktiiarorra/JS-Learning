    <!-- Next up, we'll continue talking about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, under the surface,

under the hood, that's better.

That's what I was looking for.

I know I said under the surface, under the hood.

OK, so this is all information that's going to help us understand why it's going to motivate why we're

learning things like Promises and async functions and why this all matters in JavaScript and in other

languages.

It may not be an issue in some others it is, anyway.

This sentence in front of us JS JavaScript is single-threaded.

What does that mean?

This is a vast simplification, but basically it means that there is this one thing in JavaScript that

can be working on a process at any given point.

Think of it as having a one-track mind.

It cannot be multitasking in the sense that it's actually doing two things simultaneously.

So another way of putting it is that JavaScript is running at most one line of code at a time.

Now it can switch back and forth between different lines of code.

They all happened very, very quickly for the most part.

So we don't really think about it.

We don't think that only one thing is happening at one time.

But the reality is that JavaScript itself, at any given point in time, is running at most one line

of code.

Now, that seems like it could be very problematic.

For example, shortly we're going to get into AJAX and making requests, loading information, using

JavaScript.

So we'll write code on the frontend that says things like Hello, movie API, please send me all the

movies that match bat.

They have bat in a title or in their title.

Well, that's going to take time.

That could take a split second half a second.

Or if our Internet connection is poor if the server is down, if we have no Internet, that could take

a couple of seconds or more to timeout.

Or if we're trying to load something large, like a really large image or a huge set of data, I mean,

that sometimes can take quite a while.

So what happens in between that time?

When I request it, I write the code to ask for something and then the time where I actually get a response.

Well, if JavaScript can only do one thing at a time and this takes time, let's just say it takes five

seconds.

Does that mean nothing happens in my code for five seconds?

Is everything just going to grind to a halt?

What if I had something like this?

This is, you know, not fully implemented code, but this is a common thing we might do.

newTodo do equals some value from an input.

And then I'm calling some function.

It doesn't actually exist right here called saveToDatabase.

And that can take time as well.

My database is somewhere else.

It's on a server somewhere.

I've got to send a request and I need to hear back from the database or from the server that says,

OK, that worked or no, that didn't work.

So that might take, let's say, another five seconds.

So is there five seconds in between this line running and this line where we extract the value and then

a user waits for five seconds or ten seconds or longer, and then we set the input to have an empty

string or just reset it to be empty.

That is not a good experience for a user.

And fortunately, that's not what happens.

Even though JavaScript can only do one thing at a time, it can only focus it can run one line at most,

one line at a time.

There are ways around this.

For example, we've seen this before,

setTimeout. setTimeout is a way of running some code after a delay.

OK, so imagine that I have a nice little console.log.

Right, and I have.

Hello everyone.

And then I have my setTimeout, which just as a recap, it receives or it expects a function as an

argument.

So I'll just do an arrow function.

And in here let's pretend actually instead of hello everyone, let's go with sending request to server.

I'm just going to fake it.

And then in here after the second argument is a number of milliseconds.

So in this case, three thousand.

aka three seconds after three seconds, I'm going to printout here is your data from the server and

we'll just pretend we actually got something back.

All right.

And then down here, hopefully this is all recap, but I'll console.log.

I am at the end of the file.

All right.

So what order do we expect to see things printed out in when I actually run this?

This hopefully is obvious.

This happens first, then this code runs.

And we just talked about how only one thing at a time can happen.

Right.

So are we just waiting for three thousand milliseconds?

Is JavaScript just counting, you know, one thousand 1001, 1002, 1003?

No, it does not just sit there hogging everything and stopping this code from running.

And instead this runs this runs kind of we'll talk about what that means and then life moves on and

it just runs this line.

And then after three seconds, this prints out.

So we can see that here.

Right.

Sending request the server.

I'm at the end of the file three seconds later.

Here's your data from the server.

So how does that work?

Why didn't things just get held up?

Why do I see this line?

Printed out.

If we just said JavaScript is single-threaded, shouldn't this just stop

everything is just waiting for three seconds.

Fortunately, the answer is no.

How does it work?

Well, the browser is actually doing the work.

It's not JavaScript.

And this is a bit of a this is the part that's really under the hood, that it's not a huge deal if

you understand this.

But it's good to know what happens is that the browser itself, your browser, whether it's Chrome or

Firefox or Safari or something else, that browser, it's not written in JavaScript.

That browser is written typically in a language like C++, and it can do things JavaScript can't do.

So what happens is that JavaScript actually is going to hand off certain tasks to the browser to take

care of browsers, come with something called Web APIs.

And these Web APIs are generally methods, things that we can call from JavaScript that basically are

handed off to the browser.

It's JavaScript saying, you know, I can't really do this.

Can you take care of this for me browser?

And these things happen in the background.

JavaScript doesn't really have to care about it because they've been handed off to the browser.

So this includes things like setTimeout, but also things like making requests, which we'll see soon.

It's the same idea.

They take time.

They could take five seconds.

They might take a split second.

It might take 10 seconds.

Hopefully not.

But JavaScript isn't the one doing it.

JavaScript isn't in charge of that.

Instead, it's handed off to the browser.

So how it works in practice is that the call stack in JavaScript is able to recognize these special

Web API functions and it can pass them off to the browser.

So it says, here you go, please remind me in three seconds to to take care of this.

And then once the browser finishes those tasks, let's say three seconds later, then they're added

back to the call stack, then JavaScript takes over again and executes the appropriate code.

So here's an example of what we just did, slightly different texts that were printed out here that

we are printing out.

console.log

I print first.

All right.

So JavaScript can do that, right?

It prints out.

I print first.

That's what we see.

Then we encounter setTimeout.

Now, that is one of the Web API functions.

So it's passed off to the browser, which I'm indicating here representing is this down here.

Hello browser.

Can you please set a timer for three seconds.

That's basically what's happening.

And then after those three seconds are up, remind me to run this function.

Okay, so then JavaScript just goes about its life.

It does the next thing, console log.

I print second and the browser this whole time is sitting there tapping its fingers, waiting and counting.

Has it been three seconds?

Has it been three seconds.

And then after it has been three seconds says Time's up, I'm the browser.

Hello JavaScript.

Make sure you run that callback now and then JavaScript runs that callback and we get I print after

three seconds.

All right.

So the whole mechanism by which this works is well, there's really two things.

One, the fact that browsers come with these functions, these things that browsers can do for us for

JavaScript.

And the second is this concept of the callback of passing a function in that is not executed right away,

but is instead executed later.

If we had just written this code as a console.log or something, it would be immediately executed.

But because it's wrapped in a function, it's it's not executed.

It's wrapped up in a function until it's time for it to run.

So this is a bit you know, we're kind of in the weeds here, but it's important to understand or at

least I find that it's helpful just because when I say things like JavaScript can only do one thing

at a time that seems entirely at odds with what we're seeing here, that this code is able to run before

this finishes.

How is it keeping track of that time and printing this out?

But remember, it's not the browser is keeping track of the time.

JavaScript just does one thing and we can actually see this over here.

I'm just going to copy my code.

That tool I showed you in the last video called Loupe, I have to replace this with an arrow function.

Forget about that.

Does not like arrow functions.

OK, let's see what happens now, so I'm going to pause and it runs our first console.log sending

request to server, OK, then I think actually I can open my console and we can see that there it is

sending request to server and then it gets to this next part, the setTimeout, and it's going to

pass that off to the Web APIs, which is what we see over here.

There it is, and then it's this is visualizing the timer, so I don't actually know if this will take

three or four seconds, but that's the principle console.log I'm at the end of the file.

So JavaScript moves on its Call

Stack does not contain this function at this point in time.

But then those three seconds are up.

The Web API is finished up, put it in the callback queue, and then JavaScript takes over again and it

runs that callback and we finally end up with all three console.logs.

So you don't need to be an expert in this.

You don't even really need to know this.

But I've found that it's helpful for what we're going to learn next.
