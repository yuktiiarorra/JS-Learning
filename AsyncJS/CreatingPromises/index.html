    <!-- -: Okay, so previously we talked about how to work

with promises that have been returned from functions,

how we can pass a call back into .then or to .catch.

But I wrote the function for us.

We didn't really go through the actual writing

of the promise,

or the creation of that promise.

In this video, I wanna talk about it.

This is not as important as working with promises

when they are returned.

In the next section after this,

we're going to be making requests

and talk about Ajax.

And we won't be creating those promises ourself.

We'll instead be just calling .then and .catch

and that sort of thing on promises

that have been made for us,

just like what we've been doing.

But it's good to know how to make promises,

and it's a more advanced topic,

and it's something you can use going forward

to improve your code.

But it's not as important

as what we've already talked about.

With that said,

here's how we make a new promise.

Just on its own, you can do this.

New promise, capital P promise like that,

and then it expects us to pass in a function.

And this function is going to have two parameters.

This is always how it works.

Two parameters,

first one we usually call resolve,

and the second one we call reject.

Now these are just parameters,

so you can name them whatever you want,

but they represent the resolution of this promise

and the rejection of this promise.

They are actually functions we can execute at any point

inside of this promise.

So for example, if I call resolve immediately,

and if I just paste this over here,

you'll see we get a promise that has been resolved,

it has a status of resolved.

If I instead called reject

or whatever I name this second parameter,

and paste it in over here,

we get a rejected promise.

And then if I do nothing

and I just make a new promise,

there's my promise object and it's still pending.

It will continue to be pending

until at some point hopefully resolve

or reject is called inside of this function.

So here's how we would use them.

Let's make our fake request function.

So I'm gonna call it fake request or something like that,

equals a function,

I guess we could pass in a URL.

Okay, and then inside of here,

we're going to take, to start,

let's just take one second or two seconds

and resolve our promise.

So we're gonna make a new promise,

new promise, just what I showed you.

And then we have our callback,

or this function inside, resolve and reject.

And then we're going to return this promise.

And then after a second, this promise will resolve.

So set timeout,

and then we have our callback in there,

our delay of one second,

and after a second we will call resolve.

So if I execute that function, fake request,

and I save it to a variable,

I'll call it request, or req,

and we can see it's now been resolved.

Now I didn't go fast enough to show you

that it was pending originally,

but it has been resolved.

So now I can add on my .catch

and .then to the fake request,

so the promise that gets returned.

We can pass an a URL even though we're not using it,

but let's do dog slash one dot then,

and then when that finishes,

we'll console that log done with request just like that.

So hopefully we should see that after a second.

There we go.

All right, so what I did in the original video was

I generated a larger delay instead of just one second,

and then I randomly rejected or resolved.

So why don't we just generate a random number,

const, we'll do rand equals,

and then math.random.

And we'll just see if rand is less than five maybe.

So if rand,

or less than 0.5 rather,

actually 50/50 chance seems a bit high.

How about if it's below 0.7, we will resolve,

otherwise we will reject,

and we can always pass a value through.

So we'll resolve with some information here,

your fake data here,

and then we'll reject with an error like,

I don't know, request error.

Okay.

So now I can add on my .catch as well.

And in here, let's console.log whatever that error is.

Oh, no.

And then error.

Up here, done with request.

And I'll console.log data is,

and then we'll print out

whatever our promise was resolved with,

which in our case is just your fake data here.

So let's see.

Oh, no request error, okay.

Oh no.

Oh no again.

There we go.

Done with request.

Data is your fake data here.

So that's the basic idea.

To make a new promise,

we just pass in this function

or a function where there are two parameters.

The first one is a function that will resolve the promise.

The second one will reject it.

Name them whatever you want,

but the only thing I've ever seen is resolve and reject.

And if at any point you call resolve,

that promise object will be resolved.

And if at any point you call reject,

the promise object will be rejected.

All right, so let's see another example.

If you remember early on in this section,

I talked about callback hell.

And we made this delayed color change function,

which changes the background color of the body

after some set delay that you can pass in.

And then we structured it

so that you could pass a callback in

that will be executed after this set timeout finishes,

or after it executes its callback.

So this happens, and then this happens,

and then this happens, and so on.

And this was before we learned about promises.

And just to recap what it looks like,

there we go.

We go from red to orange

to yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,

and then we finish.

Okay.

So you could continue with this,

but this is seven levels, right?

And it's quite nested.

So I could rewrite this to use promises instead.

My delayed color change function could return a promise.

Instead of us passing a callback in,

do next, right,

this is the next thing for that first delayed color change.

This entire thing, it's just crazy.

It's very nested.

Instead of that, I'll rewrite this function,

const delayed color change equals.

You'll pass in the color and a delay,

but not a callback.

And then we'll return a promise in here, return new promise.

And this promise, standard promise we just talked about,

we have the resolve and reject parameters,

although we're not really gonna reject this promise ever.

There's no reason to.

All that we wanna do is resolve it

after we've changed the color,

after this delay has finished.

So we're gonna do a set timeout.

Here's the function we'll run

after whatever this delay is.

So in this case, I was doing one second,

but we could make it five seconds

or three or two or it doesn't matter.

So in here I'm gonna change the body color.

So what is it,

document.body.style.background color

equals whatever color you passed in.

And then we resolve.

And that's it.

So it's a little bulkier than what we had.

Right, compare?

But it's not a huge difference.

Yeah, we have to work with this promise

that we're returning.

That's kind of annoying.

But it's worth it,

because what we're able to do now is avoid having

to nest and pass a bunch of stuff in.

I can just call delayed color change,

pass in a color like red, and a delay,

and we'll just start there, right?

This is going to run,

but we don't have anything happening after it.

Okay, it does work.

Now, if I want something to happen after it,

I can't just do this as we know.

I can't change that.

Those will happen at the same time.

So we only see orange,

but I did return a promise.

And we can see that here, that return to promise,

and eventually that promise will be resolved.

As you can see there.

It starts as pending, now it's resolved.

So I can use my .then

.then and then we'll go to orange.

Now if I return a promise,

remember from within my dot then callback,

I can chain promises.

But let's just see that this works,

red and then orange, and it does.

So I could return it like this,

or I could actually do it on a single line

and just use an implicit return,

like that.

And just keep chaining these.

Orange, yellow, green, blue.

Sorry, almost there.

Roy G Biv, indigo.

There we go, violet.

All right.

So let's verify that it works.

Get all the way to violet.

Keep going.

Looking good, looking good.

And there we go. That's violet.

Take a look at how easy this code is to read, right?

Do this and then this, and then this, and then this.

It's flat, or it's pretty much flat, right?

We have a little bit of nesting, just one level deep.

But otherwise, it's incredibly easy to read and look at

compared to this, the exact same outcome.

After one second, do this

after a second, do this,

change it to red, orange, yellow, and so on.

Exactly the same.

But because we're working with promises,

we can really clean the code up

and just make it easier to read.

And we're not even bothering with rejecting this promise.

We don't have a branching path

where we could have a success and a fail.

Everything is just success.

We're resolving this promise.

But if we did have a success and a fail,

then the nesting gets even crazier,

like we talked about earlier on in callback hell.

And promises really don't get much crazier at all.

We just add on a single dot catch

and we can catch 'em all

like it's Pokemon.

All righty, so that's how you create promises.

Again, it's something we'll be doing a ton right now.

We're really more concerned about working

with them when they've been returned to us.

In the next section after this,

we'll be doing this sort of thing a lot

where we're calling .then and passing in callbacks,

or we're calling .catch and passing in callbacks

and chaining them together.

But the promises we'll be working with

will be coming from some library,

or from some function we didn't write ourself,

but we can, right?

We know how to write this at this point.

It's just not as important.

So I'm not saying you shouldn't care at all,

but just make sure you care more about this

in the short term over actually writing promises.

Okay, bye.
