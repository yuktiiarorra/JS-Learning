  <!-- Instructor: Next, up we're going to talk

about why this pattern, a factory function,

is not commonly used and why instead,

we use something called the constructor pattern

or constructor function.

So let's start

with what you probably have seen at this point.

We've seen this new keyword occasionally,

like new XML HTTP request, I hate typing this,

but we run this if we need to make an XML HTTP request.

We're not using fetch, we're not using Axios.

Check out the requests section

if you're not sure what the heck I'm talking about.

This makes us a new object following a pattern.

Also, we can make an array with this syntax, new array.

It's definitely lengthier, it's not commonly used at all.

You could do new string.

Notice I'm using capital letters. What is that new keyword?

It's actually an operator, and we'll get to it,

and we'll talk about why it's preferable to this approach,

but let's start with understanding the shortcoming here.

It's not a huge one, but it's important to understand.

Every time I make a new color object,

we start with an empty object.

We have three unique properties.

They're added directly to the object, that makes sense,

but then these functions, they're recreated,

and a unique copy is added to each color object,

so each color object has its own RGB function.

Yeah, the values are going to always be different,

assuming that the colors are different.

We have different R, G, and Bs,

we can end up with a different result, but there's no reason

to have a unique copy of the function itself.

Just like if we were to write a regular function

called RGB out here, function RGB,

we could reuse that with any inputs.

We don't need to have function RGB two

and RGB three and RGB four

any time we wanna pass in different values.

We just make one function.

That is not what's happening here, and I can show you that.

I have two colors I've created using make color.

I have first color and I have black.

They have different values that I passed in,

so we get different objects.

We have black, where R, G, and B are zero, zero, zero,

and we have first color, not a very original name,

35, 255, 150.

Notice they have their own copy,

well, it looks like they have their own copy

of hex and RGB, and we could verify that

in a bunch of different ways.

The simplest would be if we compare black dot,

let's take hex, and compare it to firstColor.hex.

They are not equal.

Triple equals for a reference type is going to check,

and functions are reference types, as a reminder,

it will check to see if they are referring

to the same function, in this case, and they are not.

But if we compare that to something like a string,

any string, "hi" dot, what's a good method to use?

How about we use dot slice?

I'm not gonna call it,

just hi.slice triple equals bye.slice,

two different strings, notice that we get true.

Hmm.

What's happening here is that the slice method

is not defined on every single string,

or if I had worked with an array,

if we look at some array, one, two, three, four,

the methods are not defined in this individual object.

Arrays are objects.

A weird part of JavaScript, they are considered objects.

Instead, they are defined on the prototype.

Remember, we started this section off with prototypes.

Every array gets its built-in array methods

from one prototype array object.

This contains all of the methods and functionality

that we're used to using, array.pop, array.concat.

Same thing with strings.

The string prototype contains the methods,

so instead of having their own copy,

this array does not have its own copy of pop.

This string does not have its own copy of slice.

They're referencing one function,

and it's located on the prototype.

With what we've set up here,

we don't have an easy way of making that work,

so this is where the constructor function enters.

A constructor function

is kind of a weird part of JavaScript, honestly.

It's pretty different

than most other programming languages I've worked with,

but don't let that scare you.

It's not too bad.

If we go to MDN, there's a nice little explanation

of this new operator which we will use,

but first, take a look at this code right here.

We have a function.

It's starting with a capital letter,

which is just a style choice,

but inside the function, there's never a return value,

and we're referencing this directly in the function.

We're not in an object like we had here,

we created an object color

and we referenced this inside that object on a method.

Here, it's just a function,

this.make equals something, this.model.

What is going on? Well, let's try it out.

So on the docs, we had a function

and it had a capital letter, which is really just a way

of indicating that this isn't a regular function,

it is a function that helps you create objects.

It's a constructor function.

Function color, we pass in R, G and B,

and then what they did on MDN was this.R equals R,

this.G equals G, and this.B equals B.

Okay, well, let's see what happens when I call color.

When I come over here, refresh my page,

I'm gonna execute color and pass in,

and I'll just do 255, zero, and zero.

I didn't get anything back. It doesn't appear be working.

If I save that to a variable, I would just see undefined.

What if we print out this, console.log this,

and let's print it out at the end

after we've added those properties, R, G and B.

What do you think this is going to refer to?

Ooh, it refers to the window. Why is that?

Well, if you remember back

in the secret life of objects section,

we talked about the keyword this and how it behaves.

In the scope of this function,

it's not inside of any other object,

this is going to refer to the global scope,

the nearest object, which is the window object.

So then why on earth would the docs talk

about making a function like this and referring to this

in your function, not returning anything?

Well, the secret is this new operator.

When we call this function

but we call it with new before the function call,

it behaves differently.

These are the steps.

I guess I'll just copy these over and show them to you here.

When we call this color function with new, new color,

and then we pass in values 255, 40, and 100, just like that,

it's going to create a blank plain JavaScript object.

It sets the constructor of this object to another object,

we'll come back to that, passes the newly created object

from step one as the this in this context,

so it's going to make us a new object,

and it will set this to that new object,

so we'll be adding R, G, and B to that new object,

then it returns this at the end.

So it's kind of doing what we saw earlier,

const, let's just call it O, equals an object,

and then this would be referring to this object,

and then it adds these properties to that object,

and then at the end, it would return O,

but it's doing it all implicitly behind the scenes for us.

This behaves differently here than it normally does.

As we saw, if we don't use a new keyword,

this refers to the window object,

but when we use new, it's just how JavaScript works.

It's the magic of this operator.

It will be used to create a new object for you

based off of this pattern, so why don't we try it now?

I'm gonna copy this over. go back to my code, refresh.

If we just call color like that, not good.

If we call it with new, all right, take a look at this.

We get an object, and this object has properties on it

that we assigned using this.

I never told it to make an object explicitly,

I never said return an object.

It did that, and it did something else.

If we look under proto here,

it has a constructor property set to color.

That was the first or the second thing, links,

or it sets the constructor of the object to another object

using whatever we named this function,

so it sets the constructor to this color function.

What this allows us to do is now we can add methods

not to the individual objects, not to the instances,

but to the prototype.

So if I copied what we did earlier, like this RGB method,

and I put it in here,

I'll have to uncomment some of this and fix it up,

we would have something like this.rgb equals that function,

and we can access this.

It should work fine. This is not new.

This is kind of what we saw earlier.

Let's see what happens when I call new color again.

Inside of color, ah,

it still has RGB defined on the individual object.

It's not defined on the prototype, but we have a workaround.

Rather than doing this,

we would define that method on the prototype

outside of this constructor function.

It's kind of odd, but that's how it works.

We call Color.prototype.rgb equals this function.

So it's a little clunkier, but we saw the syntax already.

We saw how we could change Array.prototype.pop

and overwrite it to be some other function that did nothing.

Same idea,

so we have now made this constructor function for color.

Anytime we call it with the new keyword,

it makes us a new object,

it sets the constructor to color of that object,

and then it sets the value of this to that new empty object.

We can add properties to it, it returns that object,

so if I call, new color 40, 50, 60,

I save that to a variable, const color one.

I now have an object here that has R, G, and B,

but not only that, if we take a look at color one,

it does not have that method RGB defined

on itself on the actual object.

It's defined on the prototype.

So I can still call color1.rgb,

which is the very important part.

If we couldn't, then it wouldn't be worth doing,

but I don't have a unique copy of it here.

I can still access it from the prototype object,

just like with an array or a string, so this is now better

or more efficient than our factory approach,

where we returned a new object every time it was called,

and on that object, we added in individual methods

that were unique each time.

Now I could have two colors, color one and color two,

it could be totally different.

this one could be zero, zero, zero, zero,

and why don't I add in a second method?

We'll do Color.prototype.hex equals function,

and I'll just copy the code from right here.

Have to tweak it a bit.

Don't need that, don't need that, uncomment you, save,

and everything else should work.

We still have access to this inside of these functions.

This will be set to whatever

is on the left side of that dot, so color1.hex.

Color one will be the value of this.

If I do color two, color two will be the value of this,

even though the function is defined

as a method on the prototype.

So let's verify that color1.hex is the same as color2.hex,

because they are on the shared prototype object

rather than uniquely defined on each instance.

So we've defined a recipe for a color.

We've said every color will have this one prototype

that has RGB and hex,

and we need one copy and one copy only of those methods.

Let's test it out.

So we have color one, I can still call dot hex.

Color2.hex, I get different results

because the value of this is different inside those methods,

but then if I call color1.hex triple equals color2.hex,

hallelujah, it's true, they're pointing to the same thing,

and we can verify that also.

You just open up this object here in the dev tools.

We don't see hex and RGB defined here.

They're defined on the prototype,

so a key distinction from what we saw earlier.

All right, so why don't we end by adding one more method in?

This method will be RGBA, which I could call by color1.rgba,

and I can pass in a number from zero to one, like 0.5,

and this should give me an RGB color or an RGBA color,

which follows the same pattern here,

but it has a fourth channel, A, alpha,

which is in charge of opacity.

So I would define Color.prototype.rgba equals function,

and while I'm doing this, an important thing to note,

you don't wanna use arrow functions for this.

Remember that they behave differently with the keyword this,

so you can run into trouble,

so use traditional standard function expressions,

like I'm doing here.

So we could duplicate this line to get R, G, and B.

We also want the parameter for the alpha channel,

and why don't we give it a default of one?

If it's not passed in, we'll just do a full regular color.

It won't have any translucent, alpha will be 1.0.

Then we have to return our string template literal,

and it should be RGBA, and then we interpolate R,

we interpolate G, we interpolate B, forgot the dollar sign,

and then finally, we interpolate A,

and we also need the closing paren,

so let's test it out here.

We've got color one.

Let's see what color one looks like. I don't even know.

Color1.rgb gives us this color. Is it at all interesting?

I'm just gonna paste it in here.

Nah, it's pretty ugly.

Why don't we change that to be, how about much greener?

We'll try again. Color1.rgb gives us this.

Let's take a look. Okay, very bright green.

Now, if I wanna use that somewhere,

let's just do document.body.style.backgroundColor equals,

and I'll use color1.rgb.

There we go, pretty green. Now, let's try our RGBA method.

It has a default parameter,

so it should be the exact same color,

but now if I pass in a number like 0.80,

it's getting more translucent.

Let's go down to 0.4, 0.2, 0.1.

There we go.

So we've made this one method defined

on the color prototype,

and it works across any instances of color.

Anytime we ran new color, that's the main takeaway here,

the new keyword does these mysterious operations.

It's very confusing when you're starting out,

because if you look at this function on its own,

it seems like it shouldn't really do anything.

It doesn't ever make an object,

it doesn't ever return anything,

but you put that new keyword in front

when you execute the function,

and it changes how it behaves entirely,

and then we saw that we can add methods

to the color prototype

so that they are only defined one time

rather than on each individual color, like we had up here.

So as you can see, the syntax is kind of annoying,

and it leads to these long files

where things aren't really grouped together.

We have our color definition here,

but then all of the methods are defined separately.

This is why the class keyword

and the new class syntax was introduced,

which is what we'll see right after this,

another way of achieving the exact same outcome,

but a prettier syntax.
