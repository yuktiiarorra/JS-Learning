  <!-- Instructor: Welcome back.

In this section we're focusing

on object-oriented programming,

or at least JavaScript's flavor of OOP,

object-oriented programming.

So we'll cover things like constructor functions

and classes, super keyword, inheritance.

But we're gonna start with a quick video on a quirky,

but important aspect of JavaScript:

object prototypes.

So you may have come across this at some point.

We've briefly touched on it

throughout the course a couple times.

We're now going to take a deeper dive

into what the heck a prototype is.

What does it mean? What is this thing?

When I look at an array, what is this proto,

__proto__ property?

So that's what we're gonna talk about first,

and then we'll go more into creating constructor functions

and classes and all of that stuff.

All right, so according to MDN, prototypes are the mechanism

by which JavaScript objects inherit features

from one another.

Objects can have a prototype object,

which acts as a template object.

So what this means is that certain objects,

like, we'll take an array as an example,

an array has a whole bunch of different methods.

If we look at something like Array on MDN,

on the left side, we've seen this a couple times, Methods.

Under Methods, there are so many methods

that start with Array.prototype.

.concat, entries, every, fill, keys, push, reduce.

All these methods that we use all the time,

like [1, 2, 3].push(4).

That push method is not defined

as a method on this array right here.

If I save it to a variable,

const arr, arr, = [1, 2, 3].

If we look at that array,

I don't see any methods right here.

I mean, I could define my own method.

arr.sing = function().

And we can console.log,

how about "LA LA LA!"

Okay?

So there is a function, or a method, technically,

that I added to the array itself.

The individual array, it has a method called sing.

Remember, arrays are objects in JavaScript.

So when we added that method to arr,

we see it show up here.

But when I call arr.push, push of five,

I don't see that method listed here.

I don't see any of the methods we used.

They're all inside of this property called __proto__,

or just proto.

Some people also call this dunder.

Double underscore, dunder. I just say proto.

It's a property that references the Array prototype.

So a prototype is the template object for,

in this case, arrays.

It contains a bunch of methods, typically,

so all of these methods,

that every array will have access to.

But rather than defining them individually

in every single array, a separate copy, right,

I could make another array here.

const arr2 = [4, 5, 6].

We look at arr2,

it doesn't have its own copy of push and pop.

All that it has, just as the original array that we created,

they both share a property called proto,

which is a reference to this blueprint object,

the prototype.

This prototype contains all of the methods.

And through the magic of JavaScript,

I can simply access arr dot.

And then what's another one we haven't used yet?

How about includes? Does that array include two?

We get true.

This includes method is not defined

on every single array that we make.

It is defined on this prototype object.

Now, the reason I'm bringing this up is that it matters.

It's something we will cover and come back to

as we talk about defining classes and constructor functions.

So rather than having a separate method

on every single array called push,

there is one prototype.

And each array has a reference to that prototype

with this special property __proto__.

And we actually can see this

in other types of objects in JavaScript.

What if I take a look at the document.body?

And I save that to a variable.

Const. We'll just call this body.

If we look at body,

I'm gonna have to console.dir(body).

We'll open it up.

It has certain properties that are specific to this body.

Things like the baseURI, the background.

But then it also has a proto down at the bottom.

Its prototype is an HTMLBodyElement.

And there are different methods and properties

that correspond to that prototype template,

this HTML body template.

So that's the basic idea of a prototype

or prototypes in JavaScript.

We have this one object that is the prototype

for other types of objects.

So there is an Array prototype.

If I look at Array.prototype.

Capital A Array.

So not an individual instance of an array,

but capital A Array.

Here is everything on that Array prototype.

And I could actually define my own type of an object,

my own brand-new object,

and set its prototype to the Array prototype,

and I would have access to those array methods

in whatever object, my version of the array.

But we're not there yet.

All we need to know at this point is

that prototypes are like a template object.

That's actually what they are. They are objects.

They contain, typically, a bunch of methods.

And then we can create multiple objects

that share the same prototype

so that they all have access to the same methods,

without having to have their own copy.

Now, as a fun little demo here,

we can actually mess with or add our own properties

and methods to the Array prototype or object prototype,

or whatever prototypes we want.

There is a String.prototype as well.

Strings are kind of confusing,

'cause we've talked about how strings and numbers

and booleans are technically primitive types.

However, in JavaScript,

they all get these intermediate object wrappers.

And that's where all those string methods come from,

the String prototype.

So I could actually add on something

to the String prototype.

Right now, if I just take a look,

we see a bunch of string methods,

like concat and a property like length.

What else do we have?

substring, startsWith, search, replace.

I could add my own method called grumpus.

Go back to good ol' grumpus.

Set it to an arrow function.

And we'll just console.log.

Or how about we alert? "GO AWAY!!!"

Just like that. Okay?

So it doesn't seem like much happened.

We look at String.prototype,

this prototype object, this template for other strings,

now has a property called grumpus.

So why don't I make a new string?

I'll call this const cat = "Blue,"

I guess, one of my cats.

Now, what if I try and call cat.grumpus()?

Hey! This page says, "GO AWAY!!!"

So now every time I make a string,

at least until I refresh my page,

I now have access to a new string method, called grumpus.

I could also add on a property.

I could do String.prototype dot,

how about we do yell?

And it'll do something slightly more complicated.

I think I'm gonna move over to my code here.

Let's access String.prototype,

which, remember, is the prototype object for every string.

It is the place where string methods are stored.

I can now add on something,

let's go with yell, which will be a function.

And let's just console.log(this)

inside of here for a moment.

So we're getting ahead of ourselves,

but I wanna just show something kind of fun.

If I run my code, I make some string like "hello,"

and I call .yell(),

this referred to the string "hello."

So what I could do is console.log(this.toUppercase).

So this refers to whatever string

we're calling the method on,

which is actually something we've seen before.

Where we had an object,

and we would refer to this.x inside of that object,

this will refer to whatever's on the left-hand side

of that dot, at least in this case.

So let's try "hello".yell() again.

All right, we've just called an existing method,

.toUppercase, which is already there.

So why don't we return a template literal string,

where we have this .toUppercase()

plus a bunch of bunch of exclamation points.

And then how about some other stuff like OMG,

more exclamation points.

AGHGHGHG! That's screaming, apparently.

Okay? Refresh my page.

I make some string,

like "i love you".yell().

And this is what we get.

We've made our own method

that we can use on every single string.

It's important to realize

that this is not really a good idea.

This is not a pattern

that I would recommend you follow all the time.

It's just a demonstration of how prototypes work.

So we can add something to the Array prototype.

Array.prototype, which is a specific object, a template,

that stores methods and properties for every single array.

And we can override something, like .pop.

And we'll make that a function.

But it will just always return,

"SORRY, I WANT THAT ELEMENT,

I WILL NEVER POP IT OFF!"

Okay?

So we are now replacing the existing pop

that every array looks up to on its Array prototype.

So if I make an array like [3, 4, 5]

and I call pop(), huh, it doesn't work.

We get our version. So kind of fun stuff.

Not highly recommended, but it is going to be informative.

It'll be helpful to understand prototypes.

It's actually a relatively simple idea.

It's very intimidating I think when you're starting out.

But the idea boils down to having a single object

that contains common properties

and methods that other copies,

other objects of arrays or other strings look up to

to find their common properties.

It's a place to store things, a template, a blueprint.

There's so many ways of putting it,

but the term in JavaScript is prototype.

The one confusing thing that I would like to address

is if I make an array here,

const, I don't know, nums again.

I know, it's so boring. nums, [7, 8, 9].

If I look at nums,

what is this __proto__ versus prototype?

So they both are very similar,

and they both sound like prototype or proto.

This here, Array.prototype,

is the actual object where we add the methods to

or the properties.

This is the template object, the prototype.

This is a reference.

So __proto__ is a property name on this array,

or on this string.

I could look.

Or I don't have a string there, but I could make a string.

const dog = "timothy."

And if I look at dog.__proto__,

it's a reference to the String prototype, to this object.

So it's a reference

versus this here is the actual prototype object

that I can add on to.

But inside individual strings or arrays or other objects,

the property name that is used

to reference that actual template,

the prototype object, is __proto__.

It's pretty rare that you would ever need

to touch this yourself or do anything with __proto__.

If anything, you will be accessing

the actual prototype itself and manipulating it.

So that is a brief primer on prototypes.

Next, we're gonna talk about some basics

of constructor functions in JavaScript.
