    <!-- Instructor: Next up we have rest, which looks like spread

because it also uses three dots,

but it means something entirely different.

So to help explain this, we need to go back

and talk about something called the arguments object.

Inside of every function we've written so far,

we have access to this magical, it's not so magical,

but this thing created for us automatically

called arguments and it kind of looks

and acts like an array.

It's what we call an array like object.

We can use in indices to access elements out,

in that sense, it works exactly like an array,

except we don't have access to array methods like push

and pop and reduce and all of that stuff.

So what does it contain? What does it do?

It automatically will hold

all of the arguments passed to our function.

So I can just demonstrate this very quickly.

Let's just do a function called sum,

and we're not going to expect any arguments.

I'm just gonna say, you know, pass in whatever you want.

And I'm gonna console.log arguments.

This arguments object.

And if I refresh my page,

remember how we have methods like math.min

where I can pass in one argument or two or 10

or a thousand arguments, right?

There's no way to specify that we want one, two,

or a thousand arguments inside of the parameter list.

But this arguments object is going

to automatically collect all arguments.

So if I call some with nothing,

we see that arguments is empty.

But if I call it now with a bunch of arguments

about 34, 65 and 77,

it contains all of those values in an order.

So I can look at the zero width or the first or the second

or index of zero, index of one and two,

elements from arguments.

But I can't actually use array methods.

So it looks like an array, it acts kind of like an array,

but it's not an array.

So if I wanted to make this method sum

where I'm gonna sum all elements together.

So all arguments together, I wanna be able to do some

of three, four, five

or this where I have a bunch of numbers.

To do that, I need to loop over every argument

and sum them together.

Or I could use, reduce a standard array method.

So I could do return arguments.reduce,

and then for each, and we have our total

and then our elements.

And we'll return total plus element.

So hopefully that's review of reduce,

the problem we run into here.

This will work except for the fact

that arguments is not an array

and it doesn't have a reduced method.

So if I try that, no arguments.reduce is not a function.

So if it were a regular array, it would be, but it's not.

So this kind of sucks.

Arguments is this thing that's created for us,

but for whatever reason,

which I've actually never really thought about

or tried to look into,

but for whatever reason it's not an array.

It acts like one in some ways,

but it falls short in a lot of others.

So this is where rest comes in.

The rest operator, which is three dots,

goes in our parameter list

and it's gonna collect all remaining arguments

and put them in an actual array.

So lemme show you what that looks like.

Instead of this, I'm gonna comment that out

'cause this doesn't even work.

I'm going to create another function called sum,

and then I'm going to add a parameter in here.

I'll call it nums.

And if I just left it as nums,

that's only going to be one parameter, right?

So if I called sum

and I passed in three nums would be three.

But if I did three comma five nums is still three,

five is just ignored.

But if I use rest, one, two, three dots,

I'm collecting the rest of the parameters.

In this case, all values passed in will be

stored inside of nums.

So if I console.log nums here

and I call sum now it is an actual real array.

So it could have one value in it

or it could have a hundred values in it or more.

Lots of 23s, there we go. That's our nums array.

It's up to us to come up with that name.

But what's great about this is that it's a real array.

So I can now do things like I'll just copy this,

return, but instead of arguments.reduce,

I can also just name this something like nums,

arguments, we can't choose that name.

It's just always arguments.

Nums is just the name of a parameter

I can customize at will.

All right, so let's see if this works. There we go.

I assume that's a correct answer.

Let's just do something a little bit easier.

One, two, and three. And we do get six.

Okay, now it is called rest.

So collect the rest of the values.

And that does mean that we can have some named parameters

that we call out first.

For example, if I had a function called medal ceremony.

Now how about race results?

And we're expecting a gold medal finisher, a silver.

And then just for the sake of brevity,

let's just do everyone else

and collect them all in their own parameter.

So that will be an array, just like it was here with nums.

And let's just print out, I don't know, console.log

gold medal goes to.

And then here we'll do gold

and then we'll do the same thing here.

Silver goes to silver.

And then our final one will just be everyone else,

I don't know, and thanks to everyone else.

And then we'll just print out everyone else,

which will be an array.

Okay, so let's try calling that race results.

We'll say first place gold medal was, I don't know, Tammy.

And then silver was Todd.

And then everyone else really,

it's just a list of arguments.

So let's do Tina and Trevor and Travis.

Lots of T names there. And there we go.

Gold medal goes to Tammy, silver goes to Todd.

And thanks to everyone else, Tina, Trevor, Travis.

So what we did there was called out

the first two specifically

and then collected the rest into everyone else.

So this is super useful. We can't do that with arguments.

Arguments just holds everything in it.

So if I tried to replicate this,

I would have to call out arguments of zero,

arguments of one, to get the first two,

and then everything else would be arguments of two onwards.

The last thing to note about arguments is

that it just doesn't work instead of arrow functions at all.

So that's another reason to use rest parameters.

Remember, it's three dots. It's different than spread.

We're not spreading things out.

We're actually doing the opposite.

We're collecting things into a single parameter.

So that's rest.
