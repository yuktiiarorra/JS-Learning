<body>Instructor: All right, so let's start learning

    about loops in JavaScript.
    
    The whole point of looping is to repeat some functionality.
    
    So instead of having to have, I don't know,
    
    the same thing happened 10 times in a row
    
    by writing it 10 times, we can instead,
    
    it's not really automating it,
    
    but we can instead repeat it using a loop.
    
    So a loop is simply a way of repeating some functionality,
    
    and that can be something simple.
    
    Print the word hello 10 times.
    
    Instead of having to copy and paste to console.log
    
    hello 10 times myself, I could use a loop,
    
    or I could sum every number in an array,
    
    and that might be two numbers,
    
    but that could be 10,000 numbers,
    
    and if I didn't use a loop, that would be a lot of work.
    
    So there are multiple types of loops,
    
    four loops and while loops,
    
    for of loops, for in loops.
    
    We will see them in this section or in this unit.
    
    Here's another example of where loops are used.
    
    This is Reddit. Once again, the BackYardChicken subreddit.
    
    This is a cute photo.
    
    Some person just had four, no, three Silkie chickens.
    
    These fluffy white chickens just show up
    
    in their coop one day.
    
    They don't know how they got them.
    
    Anyway, there's a bunch of comments,
    
    probably a couple hundred different comments here,
    
    and they're stored in an array somewhere.
    
    And then each comment needs to be displayed,
    
    as we can see it here.
    
    The title or rather the username is posted,
    
    the number of points, how many days ago, you know,
    
    the actual comment text.
    
    All of that stuff has to be displayed,
    
    and we don't know how to do that yet, but we will.
    
    But anyway, imagine it takes five lines of code
    
    for one comment just to display it.
    
    Well, then we have hundreds of comments,
    
    does that mean that there's, you know, 500 or 1,000
    
    or 10,000 lines of code just to display this stuff?
    
    No, instead we use, or we don't do this,
    
    but (chuckles) the developers at Reddit use a loop
    
    where they can do something like, for every single comment
    
    in the array of comments, do these five lines,
    
    and that shortens, drastically shortens,
    
    the amount of code that has to be written.
    
    So we'll get our first taste of loops in this video.
    
    We're gonna talk about the for loop.
    
    And I need to warn you a tiny bit that the syntax
    
    for for loops, if you're brand new to this
    
    and you've never heard of a for loop,
    
    might be a little intimidating, so buckle up,
    
    not because it's hard,
    
    but it's just a little bit unintuitive at first.
    
    This is the technical for loop syntax,
    
    the pattern for every for loop we write.
    
    Now this probably looks
    
    like (chuckles) nothing meaningful to you,
    
    so let me show you an example.
    
    This right here is a for loop.
    
    This for loop is going to print all
    
    of the numbers from 1 to 10.
    
    So I've got a script over here, new app.js, new index.
    
    There's nothing to look at, just an empty page.
    
    And I'm going to go into my app.js
    
    and do a console.log(1).
    
    And then I'll fast forward through this,
    
    but I'll have 10 numbers here.
    
    So two, three, and so on.
    
    Okay, so silly, but I'm printing the numbers 1 one to 10,
    
    and that takes 10 lines.
    
    Now if I had, you know, I want to print 100 numbers
    
    or 1,000 numbers, it's gonna scale
    
    with that number that I'm trying to print.
    
    If I'm trying to print 10,000 different numbers,
    
    that means 10,000 console.logs.
    
    Let's just take a look at this though. Refresh it.
    
    Okay, 1 to 10.
    
    Now if I wanna do this using a loop,
    
    I can rewrite the whole thing in two or three lines,
    
    and that's exactly what this for loop does.
    
    So I'm just gonna write it out first,
    
    and then we'll go over each piece.
    
    So I'm gonna comment this out
    
    so we just have a record of that.
    
    For and then
    
    for(let I = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    
    console.log(i)} with my parentheses.
    
    Okay, so let's see if it works. I'll refresh.
    
    And it looks exactly the same.
    
    The main difference now is that, can you see this over here?
    
    It says line 13 from app.js.
    
    All of these are coming from line 13, which is right there,
    
    whereas before, they were coming from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    
    and so on because each one of them is on a separate line,
    
    each console.log.
    
    All right, so let's take a look at the syntax here.
    
    How does this work?
    
    Well, what I'm doing is making a new variable for this loop.
    
    I'm calling it i.
    
    It can be named whatever I want,
    
    but it's really, really common to use i in a for loop
    
    because this variable doesn't really do anything
    
    anywhere else in our code.
    
    It exists for the purpose of this loop and that's it.
    
    So i often, I think it stands for index originally,
    
    but I'm not even sure if that's true.
    
    It's just a little counter variable.
    
    It doesn't really mean a lot. It's just gonna be a number.
    
    So in this case, I started off at 1, all right?
    
    And our loop runs, and it console.logs 1.
    
    So that's what we see. If I refresh, we get one.
    
    Now we have these two other pieces separated by semicolons.
    
    This middle part is a Boolean expression,
    
    and as long as this evaluates to true,
    
    the loop will continue running.
    
    So i is 1.
    
    Is 1 less than or equal to 10?
    
    Yes, it is, so we're still looping.
    
    And then the third piece here is
    
    called the increment expression.
    
    This is where we update the value of i.
    
    So i begins at 1. Is that less than 10?
    
    Yes, we add one to i, So now it's 2.
    
    Is that less than or equal to 10?
    
    Yes, it is, so now we add one more.
    
    We go 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We get to 10.
    
    i is 10. Is that less than or equal to 10?
    
    Yes, it's equal, So we console.log 10,
    
    and then we add one to i, it's now 11.
    
    And then this is run again, and it returns false,
    
    and our loop finishes running.
    
    So these three pieces are always there.
    
    We come up with some variable, often called i,
    
    but again, you can name it whatever you want.
    
    Just be consistent.
    
    If you name this, you know, num,
    
    then you need to write num <= 10
    
    and num++, console.log(num).
    
    That's all fine. You just need to be consistent.
    
    So we have this variable, it starts at 1.
    
    while we are less than or equal to 10,
    
    while num is smaller or equal to 10, do this,
    
    and after each iteration add one, num++.
    
    We could also do num += 1, right?
    
    Same thing.
    
    So like I said, this can take a little bit of time
    
    to get used to or to get comfortable with,
    
    but it's a really, really common idea in JavaScript.
    
    So three pieces, create a variable, do something
    
    to that variable after every loop while something is true.
    
    So separate them by semicolons,
    
    and then whatever code I put in here,
    
    I could put something else like,
    
    console.log("IM IN THE LOOP BODY!!!").
    
    whatever code is in there will run
    
    each time my loop executes.
    
    So this is where I could do something like, you know,
    
    display Reddit comment and then have that happen 10 times
    
    or 1,000 times or 100 times.
    
    I dunno why I did 1,000 then 100.
    
    I meant to say 100,000 (chuckling).
    
    So that's what we could do inside of a loop.
    
    We could repeat that very lengthy thing
    
    that might be 10 lines of code or 100 lines of code.
    
    We're doing something very simple right now.
    
    We're just repeating two lines of code
    
    that are kind of useless,
    
    but this idea of a loop comes up over and over again.
    
    You might say over and over and over and over and over
    
    and over and over, you know, like a loop.
    
    Okay, so we'll get more practice
    
    with for loops in the next video.

    Instructor: Okay, so we've seen our basic introduction

to a for loop.

They all follow this pattern,

some initial expression with some variable,

it's like a counter,

and then we have our condition that dictates how long

or when the loop should run until,

and then we have our increment expression,

which is really not a great name for it.

That is what the docs use on MDN.

But you can decrement.

You could do something like divide your number

or multiply your number.

But typically we are going upwards and we're incrementing.

So let's make another variation.

Let's make a loop that prints out even numbers,

even numbers from zero to 20.

Okay, so it would be...

Let me just comment this out

so we don't get a whole bunch of numbers.

For(let i),

which is pretty common to use i, as we've seen,

we'll start at zero and we want to go while I...

We can do less than or equal to 20,

or we could just say less than 21.

Really, for some reason my brain prefers less than or equal.

I don't know, maybe it just seems more explicit to me.

But it is an extra character to put that equal sign in there

when we could get away with less than 21.

Anyway, then after that,

we need to figure out what we're going to increment i

each time through this loop.

If I just did += 1, console.log(I),

we hopefully know what to expect, zero to 20.

But I want even numbers.

So I want zero

and then I want to skip one and go right to two

and then go to four and go to six.

So I'm going to += 2.

So I will start at zero.

Is zero less or equal to 20? Yes.

So we console.log zero.

Then we're going to add two to i.

So next time through it's two.

And we keep going, we print out two, we add two,

and eventually we hit 18.

We add two, we get 20,

we print out 20, and then we add two, that's 22,

and this is no longer true and we're done.

And that's what we get, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on.

All right, now if I wanted to skip that zero

and just do 2, 4, 6, 8, how could we do that?

Well, it's just the starting point.

We'll start at two.

Now what if I wanted to do odd numbers?

So 1, 3, 5, 7.

Well, I could start at one and now we're adding two.

And that doesn't mean something's even if you add two to it.

It's just two more than what you had before, right?

So one plus two is 3, 5, 7, and there we go.

We have odd numbers.

Okay, so let's do one more example.

Let's do something pretty different.

Let's count down from 100.

And I wanna print out 100

and then 90, 80, 70, 60, all the way down.

Whoa, I was trying to dot, dot, dot.

Auto complete got in the way.

All the way down to, should we do zero?

Yeah, let's end at zero or 10.

Let's do zero, okay?

So we're gonna need to make a variable.

Often, we'll call it i.

And it will start at 100.

And in our loop we'll print out i.

We want to run while i is less than or equal to zero.

No, while i is greater than or equal to zero

because we are going to be counting down

and subtracting from i.

So here we're incrementing, we're adding two each time,

but I want to subtract.

So for(let i =)...

Not zero.

Gosh, it's just ingrained in my brain

because that's the most common thing we do.

We'll start at 100.

I needs to be greater than or equal to zero,

if I wanna include zero,

and then i -= 10.

So each time through subtract 10 from i.

Let's see what happens.

Console.log(i).

Refresh and it works.

10, 90, 80, 70, all the way down to...

I mean 190, 80, 70, all the way down to 20, 10, 0.

Cool.

So those are a couple more for loops.

You can even do really weird things that...

Honestly, this is incredibly uncommon,

but I could have my variable i start at 10

and I want i to be greater than or equal to.

Let's do less than or equal to 100.

And I'm gonna multiply i each time.

i = i times 10.

Or I can just do i *= 10.

So let's do it while we're less than 1,000.

So this will be very short.

We'll start at 10.

We print that out.

We multiply by 10, so we get to 100 and we print that out.

And then we multiply by 10 again.

So just wanted to demonstrate that we can do this.

We could use multiplication or subtraction, even division,

but it's almost, I won't say guaranteed,

but more likely than not,

what you'll see is just incrementing i,

adding one, sometimes adding something else,

but usually you're just adding one, honestly.

And I'll show you some situations

where this is a lot more useful

than just printing out numbers like we're doing here.

But we have to understand the foundation, the basic syntax.

Okay, so the three pieces separated by semicolons

are the variable that we create for the loop,

the expression that needs to be true

for the loop to continue running,

and then the increment portion

or decrement or whatever we're doing.

We should be changing the value of our variables

in some way so that eventually this becomes false

and the loop stops.

Otherwise our loop will never end.

And that's something we're about to talk about.


for(int i Instructor: Okay, so we've seen our basic introduction

to a for loop.

They all follow this pattern,

some initial expression with some variable,

it's like a counter,

and then we have our condition that dictates how long

or when the loop should run until,

So we console.log zero.

Then we're going to add two to i.

So next time through it's two.

And we keep going, we print out two, we add two,

and eventually we hit 18.

We add two, we get 20,

we print out 20, and then we add two, that's 22,

and this is no longer true and we're done.

And that's what we get, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on.

All right, now if I wanted to skip that zero

and just do 2, 4, 6, 8, how could we do that?

Well, it's just the starting point.

We'll start at two.

Now what if I wanted to do odd numbers?

So 1, 3, 5, 7.

Well, I could start at one and now we're adding two.

And that doesn't mean something's even if you add two to it.

It's just two more than what you had before, right?

So one plus two is 3, 5, 7, and there we go.

Gosh, it's just ingrained in my brain

because that's the most common thing we do.

if I wanna include zero,

and then i -= 10.

So each time through subtract 10 from i.

Let's see what happens.

Console.log(i).

Refresh and it works.

10, 90, 80, 70, all the way down to...

I mean 190, 80, 70, all the way down to 20, 10, 0.

Cool.

So those are a couple more for loops.

You can even do really weird things that...

Honestly, this is incredibly uncommon,

So each time through subtract 10 from i.

Let's see what happens.

Console.log(i).

Refresh and it works.

10, 90, 80, 70, all the way down to...

I mean 190, 80, 70, all the way down to 20, 10, 0.

Cool.

So those are a couple more for loops.

You can even do really weird things that...

Honestly, this is incredibly uncommon,

but I could have my variable i start at 10

and I want i to be greater than or equal to.

Let's do less than or equal to 100.

And I'm gonna multiply i each time.

i = i times 10.

Or I can just do i *= 10.

So let's do it while we're less than 1,000.

So this will be very short.

We'll start at 10.

We print that out.

We multiply by 10, so we get to 100 and we print that out.

And then we multiply by 10 again.

So just wanted to demonstrate that we can do this.

We could use multiplication or subtraction, even division,

but it's almost, I won't say guaranteed,

but more likely than not,

what you'll see is just incrementing i,

adding one, sometimes adding something else,

but usually you're just adding one, honestly.

And I'll show you some situations

where this is a lot more useful

than just printing out numbers like we're doing here.

But we have to understand the foundation, the basic syntax.

Okay, so the three pieces separated by semicolons

are the variable that we create for the loop,

the expression that needs to be true

for the loop to continue running,

and then the increment portion

or decrement or whatever we're doing.

We should be changing the value of our variables

in some way so that eventually this becomes false

and the loop stops.

Otherwise our loop will never end.

And that's something we're about to talk about.

 for(let i = 20; i >= 0; i += 1)
 {
     console.log(i);
 }
 Professor: Next up,

we have to confront the grave disturbing

and dark reality of infinite loops.

They're real

and they will cause you infinite pain

and suffering.

Now I actually, they're not that bad,

but they, they are frustrating

and there's something you should know about.

So let's talk about them.

An infinite loop

is basically what it sounds like.

It's a loop that does not stop.

It runs technically it doesn't run forever.

It doesn't run at infinitum

because your browser

and JavaScript are going to run out of memory

and things are gonna come to a crippling, crushing halt.

But they will run on

and on and on and on

and push your machine to a place

it does not want to go.

Sometimes it will just cause your browser window

to just lock up entirely.

I've had it where my Chrome console has just,

or my Chrome browser has just force quit unexpectedly.

These days the tools have gotten a bit better

so you can halt them.

But yeah, infinite loops are not good.

You're basically using a ball the memory

that JavaScript has for you

because your loop just never stops.

So the important thing to keep in mind

when you're writing any loop

is always pay attention to

how is this loop going to stop?

And is this correct?

Am I actually going to hit this

stopping point at some point?

So here's an example.

We start with I at 20.

This loop runs as long as I

is greater than or equal to zero

and we add one each time through.

Well, that's gonna be a huge problem

because we're starting at 20, we're adding one.

So we're gonna be 20, 21, 22, 23.

And this loop just runs as long

as I is greater than or equal to zero.

Well, it starts out greater than zero

and it's only getting further away from zero.

We're adding one each time.

So this is never going to be false, this condition

and our loop will just run and run and run.

So make sure when you're writing your four loops

that you've stopped for a moment.

You think about it, is this condition going to be false?

If so, eventually it might be one iteration away,

it might be a thousand iterations.

It's fine to loop thousands

and thousands of times,

but you don't want an uncontrolled infinite loop

that is never going to stop

or at least it's gonna barrel through all

of your computer's memory.

So let me show you an example just

so you can see what it looks like.

So let's start with I set two.

What should we do?

Let's go 20

and then let's go I,

I'll just recreate what I had there.

I greater than or equal to zero,

i plus plus

console.log I,

oh boy, here we go.

I actually don't know exactly

what my browser's going to do while I'm recording.

Here we go though.

Start at 20, add one each time.

We're always greater than or equal to zero.

I'm going to refresh.

Oh boy.

Alright, so already things are sort of jumping around

and it seems like it's stopped, right?

It seems like it's stopped at 7,000.

But if I try

and do something else in here,

I'm typing, I'm hitting delete.

Look at how laggy this is.

I'm holding delete.

I mean it's barely working.

And if I try

and run some code, like what is one plus one?

I hit enter.

It's not working, nothing is working.

So I can't actually do anything in this window.

If I go to the actual window, it corresponds to,

can you see how it's just,

oh boy, this is not good.

It's not the end of the world,

but it is running still.

And the console has just decided

to stop counts without logging things.

But that does not mean

that the loop is actually done.

So don't get, don't be deceived

and think it only ran 7,259 times.

It's still going.

So I'm just gonna close this window

and hope for the best.

Now, I don't know if you can hear my computer fan,

it is kicked in full blast.

Lemme try moving this closer.

Can you hear that? [Voice Softens]

It's not good.

My computer is not happy with me.

It's gonna be fine.

We'll need a little bit more therapy,

need some time away from each other

and we'll come back

and you know.

Okay, so I just reopened the file in a new window

and, we're good to go.

I can start using my console again

and my computer will eventually cool down here.

So it's not the end of the world,

but it can be very problematic

and they almost always catch you off guard

or catch you by surprise if you're predicting them.

I mean, I guess I just did

because I'm teaching infinite loops.

But if you're predicting

that you're gonna have an infinite loop,

you're almost always, I dunno why you wouldn't,

you're just gonna fix it ahead of time

because it's really a nuisance.

So I'm commenting this out

and making it very clear that this is an infinite loop.

I'll leave it in the code

so that you have it.

Just, I don't know if you wanna follow along,

if you wanna just test your, your browser

and get, turn your computer's fans on

for no reason, go ahead.

But I'm just gonna comment that out.

The good news about infinite loops, right?

To fix them, generally it's not a lot of work.

You usually have just made a, a logic mistake

or you're thinking about things in the wrong direction.

So here, if I'm trying to, let's say I wanted

to print out numbers from 20 to zero.

Well I missed, I should have gone down.

I minus, minus.

Or maybe I wanted to do something else.

Like as long as I is less than

or equal to some number, not zero,

but I need to figure out some way of making this work

where it's not gonna run forever.

And this is only four loops that we've seen so far.

But infinite loops are also common.

When we talk about wild loops, we'll see some more examples

where things could go wrong.

It's just a part of working with loops.

So be careful,

but you know, don't,

don't paralyze yourself in fear.

It's really not a huge deal.

You just wanna avoid it whenever possible

and just pay attention to your code, right?

There are some repercussions if you screw up a variable name

or you have a typo,

you get a little error in your console.

It's not the the biggest deal at all.

It's pretty quick.

If you have an infinite loop, sometimes it can be obnoxious

and cause you a minute or two of grief.


Instructor: So looping over

and creating a bunch of numbers to print out

is not all that useful.

But we do use loops all the time

when we're interacting with arrays.

Now there's more than one way of doing this

and we'll see some others

that are a little bit nicer

later on

in just a few videos, actually.

But one option to loop over an array,

we also call it iterating over an array,

doing something with or for each element in an array,

is to use a for loop

and to create a number, usually called i

that we'll use to refer to an element's index in the array.

So indices start at zero

and then they go up to the end,

the length minus one, right?

So there's three elements here.

The highest index is two.

So we could loop from zero to one to two

and then use that index

to access the element in the array.

And that's exactly what I'm doing here.

i starts at zero

while i is less than animals.length.

Whatever that is.

That could be three.

It could be 100.

i plus plus.

And then I'm printing out i just so you can see it.

And animals, square brackets, i.

So animals of zero, lions.

Animals of one, tigers.

animals of two, bears.

Oh my.

So this is a pretty common template.

Let i equals zero, i less than some array.length,

i plus plus,

in a for loop, at least.

That will iterate over every,

well every index, right?

It doesn't give us the element itself.

We have to plug that i, the number

into the array.

So here's an example with a much larger array.

I found a list,

an alphabetical list of some popular animals.

Although some of them are kind of obscure.

It's unclear why we have just a lion,

generic lion and llama, right?

We don't have like specific subspecies of lions

and then we end up with

Northern Right Whale

or Przewalski's wild horse.

I mean some of these are pretty specific.

Anyway, lots of animals, right?

I don't know how many are in here.

So I'm not gonna be able to hard code a loop,

a for loop

that runs 20 times or a thousand times.

I'm not gonna be able to determine

just by looking at this,

how many elements

I need to iterate over.

So if I wanna print out each animal in here,

I need to do for something.

So for let i.

We'll start with index of zero

and then I'm gonna go;

while i is less than

and my array is called animals.

There it is.

While i is less than

animals.length.

So, I mean I could also do

less than or equal two animals.length minus one.

That's our greatest index.

But this is shorter here.

So whatever that length is,

let's say there's five, nah,

I was gonna say 500,

probably 250, 300 elements in this array.

The highest index,

if there's 300 elements,

the highest index is 299.

So, we want to stay less than the length,

not equal to.

Otherwise we'll get an undefined at the end.

And then we add one to i each time.

And then here, why don't we just console.log

i and then,

well, let's just do i first

and see what we get.

Okay? So, 312,

Hey, I wasn't that far off.

So the highest index is 312.

The lowest is zero, of course.

And now if I wanna print out the animal itself,

animals square bracket, i.

Just like, I myself would do animals of zero

to get the first one

and animals of 312 to get the last one.

Zorilla. What is a zorilla?

Interesting. African weasel.

It looks like a skunk

in my backyard.

Oh, so cute.

Alright, so that's a Zorilla.

Anyway, let's run this now

where I'm using that index,

a new index each time through the loop

to access animals at that index.

Refresh the page.

And here we are.

So I'm printing out the index just so you can see it.

Zero is aardvark.

One is aardwolf.

Two is African elephant,

Three, African tree Pangolin.

Ugh, pangolins.

If you ever wanna just really be deeply disturbed

and saddened by the state of the world,

just look at photos of pangolins being illegally trafficked.

It's just sad.

They're just little cute armored animals stuffed into a box.

Anyway,

on a lighter note here,

I don't have a lighter note, do I?

It's very sad.

Okay, on a coding note,

let's go in reverse.

I'm iterating from the beginning to the end of the array.

Let's go the other direction.

So stop and think about this on your own, if you would like.

What do we need to do?

Well, we need to start with the highest index.

So what is the highest index?

i equals animals.length.

That's not quite it.

Animals.length is gonna be, you know, whatever.

What? 313,

if that's the,

if the highest index is 312, it's one more.

So we want this;

animals.length minus one.

Then I want to keep going

while something, we'll come back to that.

And I wanna subtract one from i each time.

So we start with 312 as our i

and then 311, 310.

And we want to keep going

while i is greater than

or equal to zero

or just greater than negative one, right?

We want to have zero be one of the indices

that we actually use

because there's an index of zero.

That's the first element.

i minus, minus,

let's do a console.log,

Animals of i.

So don't forget, you've gotta access the array with i.

i is just a number.

We're generating a bunch of numbers, the indices,

but we have to plug them into the array.

Okay? So let's see what we end up with here.

Looks good.

Let's make sure we start with zorilla

all the way down to aardvark.

And there we go.

So, super common to iterate over arrays.

And this used to be the,

one of the more common ways of doing things,

but actually in the last couple of years,

there's an even easier way of iterating over arrays.

We will see it shortly,

but you should still know how to do this.

I mean, it's just a for loop.

We're just plugging our i

or whatever we name this

into an array.

All right, next up

we've gotta talk about nested loops.


Instructor: So next up we need to talk

about nesting loops.

So having one for loop, in this case, for loops

instead of another for loop.

We can nest all sorts of loops.

Once we get to wild loops, they could nest to one inside

of another, or I could nest a wild loop

inside of a for loop or vice versa.

But today, right now we're talking about nesting for loops.

So the idea here is literally putting a for loop

inside the body of another for loop.

But in practice, what this means is that

for every single iteration of the outer loop,

let's say it runs five times, the inner loop is going

to have its own full cycle.

Five separate times, it gets a full cycle.

So lemme try and illustrate that in a better way.

Let's make a simple for loop. For let I equals 0.

Let's go from zero to maybe 10.

So I less than 10, or maybe we'll do one to 10.

Okay, so less than or equal to 10, and then I plus plus.

And we'll print out console.log I.

Let's use a string template literal.

I is, and then let's print out I.

Okay, so let's just make sure that works

and I didn't screw it up.

Cool. One, two, three, four, five, all the way down to 10.

Now I'm gonna nest a loop afterwards

and this time, I'm not gonna use I.

I'm gonna use J, which is pretty common to use.

Just other single letters. Usually it's I and then J.

And if we had a third level of nesting, we could use K.

That's the alphabet, right? H, I, J, K, L, yes.

You don't have to do any of that.

You could name this first I and second I,

or sometimes people use inner

and outer just to make it easier

because honestly, I is easy enough

to keep track of when it's one loop.

But when you have I and J and maybe K,

it's a big headache to wrap your head around.

But we'll just do I and J because that's really common.

And I'm gonna start with J. I'll do this.

Should I do the same thing?

Maybe we'll just do from one to three.

So one I less than or equal to three

or we'll do less than four, maybe.

I plus plus, see, I already screwed it up.

See how I did I here?

I'm supposed to be working with J.

I think I'm gonna leave this in the video just

to illustrate the perils of working with nested loops.

One of the issues here, at least for me,

is it's so easy to mix that up.

Trust me, I edit a lot of stuff out.

It's very easy for me to do that.

But I think I'll keep it in here

because that's very real,

at least to my experience writing nested loops.

Okay, and here I'm just gonna console.log J is,

let's do a string template literal, just like this.

So J is, and then we'll put J there.

And I'm just gonna add a bunch of space in here

so that we can see it visually printing out differently.

So I'll fix that string template,

literal, and let's take a look.

Okay, so that's why I indented it.

So we can see that's the J inner loop a little bit clearer.

So let's walk through what happens.

Our outer loop runs 10 times.

So I is going to be one and then it'll be two

and then three and so on.

But while I is one,

we have this entire nested loop which runs

for J starting at one up to, but not including four,

so one to three.

So we end up with one iteration for J, two, three for J,

all while we're on the first iteration for I.

And then we get to the end of this line

or the end of this loop and then we move on and I goes up

and I is now two and the whole process repeats.

So we end up with one, two, three for J,

and this happens 10 times total

because this outer loop runs 10 times.

So you can see what we end up with. I is one.

And then here's our three loops,

three iterations on the inner loop.

I is two, three iterations on the inside.

So whenever you have nested loops,

you end up with a lot of iterations.

It's very, very different from just two side by side loops.

This runs 10 times, roughly,

this runs three times, 13 total console.logs, right?

If I just ran that right now, I'm not gonna count,

let's just say roughly 13.

I might have messed up the inclusiveness or exclusiveness.

Now when I put this inside, now we end up with 10 iterations

and on each iteration, we're doing three things.

So roughly to calculate the number of iterations,

we would multiply 10 times three here.

So we get 30, although that's really the amount

of inner iterations here or the console.logs.

We have 30 of these and then we've got 10 of these.

So it's more like 40 total. The specifics don't matter.

I just want you to understand that it's a lot more.

One common area where nested loops come up is when we need

to traverse or iterate across nested arrays.

So I've got an example here. I'm calling it seeding chart.

This variable, it's an array full of three sub arrays

and it's supposed to represent, you know,

if you're, I don't know, a middle school teacher

or something, you have to make it a seating chart

of the different chairs and desks and all of that

and figure out who sits where,

based upon a whole bunch of criteria,

you know, who works well together,

who are the mortal enemies

and the best friends who are gonna chat too much.

And I don't know, I've never taught middle school,

but I remember there being a seating chart.

So each one

of these sub arrays could represent a row, right?

So we've got our first row, second row, and third row.

And let's say that I want

to print them all out, just something simple,

just print out every student's name,

like I'm doing roll call or something, okay?

So to do that, one loop is not enough.

I could do for, let I equals zero.

I is less than seatingChart.length, i++.

And then if I console.log seating chart

of I, what will I see?

What will be printed out here?

Well I'm printing out the entire array.

So if I wanted to instead print out each individual name,

what I need to do is now loop over seating chart of I.

Seating chart of I is just this.

The first time through I is zero,

so seating chart of zero.

Then next time through, seating chart of I, I is one.

So it's this sub-array, and then I is two and it's this

and then I is three and we're done.

There is no index three in this array.

So then I need to iterate over seating chart of I

and what I'd like to do at least is save that

to a variable seating chart of I.

That represents a row.

So let's just make a variable called row, right?

This is our first row, it's smaller, only three students,

three desks, and then our second row and third row.

So now we need to iterate over row.

So for, most commonly you'll see J,

let J equal zero, J is less than.

And this is where you have to be careful.

We're not working with seeding chart anymore.

We're working with row because I made that variable.

So J is less than row.length j++,

and then let's console.log row of J.

And up here, well we can just start with that

and make sure it works.

There we go, we're getting every student from Kristen down

to Erica, and I could do a console.log row.

Why don't I do like row one, row two, row three,

so I could actually print the row number.

So I'll do row and then I can add I in here.

But there's a problem, a small problem,

which is that my number starts at zero

because I needs to begin at zero.

So why don't I make it row one, two,

and three by just adding one

to what we print out right there.

So row I plus one,

and maybe I'll put a number sign,

a little hash symbol right there.

There we go. Row number one, Kristen, Erik, and Namita.

Row number two, Geoffrey, Juanita, Antonio, Kevin.

Row number three, Yuma. Sakura, Jack, Erika. Cool.

So if you're at all lost on this bit, nested arrays,

first of all, know that you are not in the minority there.

When I teach this in person,

nested arrays and in particular, looping and iterating

over nested arrays is always a little bit tricky.

So take some time to go over it and break it down.

I mean, you can literally write out what I

and J are at each step.

I do this often on a whiteboard with students.

We'll make like a table like this. What's I, what's J?

What is row, what is seating chart of I? All that stuff.

Write it down and iterate mentally through this process

and it generally will become clearer.

If not, practice and time will help that as well.

So don't panic if you're feeling at all stuck here.

It's a really normal place

to hit a little bit of a speed bump.

Roadblock, a speed bump, whatever. Okay, bye.
