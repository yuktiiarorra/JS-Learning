    <!-- Instructor: The last use case for destructuring

we'll talk about is actually in our function parameter list.

So when we're defining a function,

we're writing our parameters between those parentheses,

we can de-structure the values that are being passed in.

And this is most frequently used with objects.

So here's an example.

We'll come back to our movies thing in just a moment,

but let's write a simple function.

This function is expecting you to pass in

some sort of user objects.

Let's just take our user objects we've been working with.

So function, why don't we just go with fullName

and it's expecting a user

and then we're going to print out

your first name and your last name

or maybe just return first name and last name.

So I could do it this way.

return and then string template literal,

write user.firstName, is it first or first name?

Okay, firstName and then a space.

user.lastName, that will work if I call it

fullName with user.

Whoops, we get Harvey Milk.

Okay, but I could use destructuring as we just saw.

So I'm gonna duplicate that

and destructure those two like this.

const firstName, lastName equals user.

And then we can just return firstName and lastName

without having to write user.

So not a big improvement, right?

This is shorter, but if we had a lot

we were doing with firstName and lastName,

then this might be nicer.

It still should work and it does.

But if I never plan on using any of the other stuff in user,

I don't need, I don't know, born, died, bio, city,

state, email, password.

I just want the first name and last name

I can destructure on the way into the function,

if that makes sense.

I can do this, function fullName, I'm expecting an object.

And from that object I want to

destructure firstName and lastName.

And then I'll just return this exact same line here.

So much shorter.

I don't have to bother with user at all.

I don't need anything else from the object,

just first name and last name.

So we'll try that.

And we get Harvey Milk still, it's working, okay?

So that's just a simple example,

but you will see that frequently.

You can also give a default value,

just like you would whenever we're destructuring

any old object like we saw previously, just like this.

That's our default last name,

if we can't find one on our object that's passed in.

So this is frequently used as well with array methods.

Just as an example, I've got these movies

and let's say that I want to filter the movies

based upon score.

So just like we did earlier,

I'll do something like movies.filter,

and then we'll do, for each movie,

let's just, well, let's call it movie.

I want to return where the movie, what is it?

movie.score is greater than

how about greater than or equal to 90.

I want the higher-rated movies.

So let's take a look at those movies.

We get those three, "Amadeus", "Parasite" and "Alien".

But another option is just to destructure score immediately

on the way in, so I don't have to do movie.score,

I can do this, curly braces score and that's it.

If I'm only using score, that's definitely shorter.

Now this is still a one-liner.

There are longer functions

and maybe in a longer function

we want title, score, and year.

I wanna destructure all three.

Let's do an example of map.

Oh, I guess I should verify and show that this does work.

There we go, same three movies.

So let's use map and I wanna map each movie.

So movies.map, and then I'll do my movie.

And then in here we'll return,

how about some sort of string template, literal in here

where we do movie.title is rated,

and then movie.score,

and then I'll put the year afterwards,

inside of parentheses movie.year.

So let's see what that looks like.

There we go.

We get "Amadeus" 1984 is rated 99.

"Sharknato" 2013 is rated 35.

So I could shorten this up by using destructuring

and this is still a pretty short function,

but I could destructure those three things on the way in.

So I do need parentheses when I'm destructuring

in a function call,

and then I'll want title, score and year,

and then I can remove movie

and just refer to those three;

title, year and score.

Verify still works and it does.

So a little bit of an improvement.

We don't have to reference movie all over the place.

We don't have to make separate variables,

we don't have to extract things ourself.

Instead, it's all done for us on the way in

thanks to these curly braces, all right?

So that's destructuring parameters

when they're passed into a function.
