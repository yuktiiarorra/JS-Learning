         AFTER CONDITIONAL4
         Instructor: Okay, so we've seen how to run our code

from a file and we've seen

how to do some simple comparisons.

How to do something like, well,

where's my console? Here we are,

is some variable, let's say age greater than 18.

But we haven't seen how to do anything

using these comparisons.

So I can check if this is true or false,

but what if I want to have one outcome if it is true,

something as simple as printing good versus bad,

or you know, enter the bar

or I'm sorry kid, you gotta go home, you're not 18.

Two different outcomes. How do we do that?

Well, that's what we're gonna see right now.

We're gonna talk about conditional statements,

so making decisions with our code.

And the first thing we'll see is the If Statement.

So down here,

if and then parentheses, some condition.

Now this condition is simply anything

that evaluates to true or false.

So if it evaluates to true,

the code in between these curly braces will execute.

Now if that condition is false, nothing happens.

Well it's not necessarily true that nothing happens,

but this code will not run.

In other words, this console.log only runs in this scenario,

if the rating variable is exactly 3,

and it's very stupid because we know it's 3.

But imagine this is coming from a database

or from a user or I don't know,

some library or some fancy website

where we don't know what rating is.

This is a way of saying if rating is exactly 3, do this.

So this syntax is incredibly commonly used.

We'll see it all over the place.

If, parentheses, some condition in that parentheses

or inside those parentheses.

So let's try it. I'm gonna make a new file,

just to get a little bit more practice here.

Conditionals and just so we're clear here,

this is an If Statement,

but we can combine this with other pieces

like Else If and Else to form a full conditional,

but it doesn't really matter in terms of terminology.

I'm gonna call this conditionals.

I'm gonna include a new script that doesn't exist yet.

New file app.js.

I'll put some code in here.

I always just like to make sure it's working.

Console.log, "ITS WORKING!!!".

Include my script, script source.

Well I did the wrong auto complete,

but we can add source ourself,

app.js, open it in my browser. Here it is.

Refresh the page, go to the console. Perfect.

It's working. Okay,

so let's now actually do our own conditional.

Let's create something really simple like if,

and we can do something trivial.

If 1 plus 1 triple equals 2,

curly braces, console.log.

How about, "MATH STILL WORKS!"?

Okay, so if that's the case, 1 plus 1 is 2.

Well hopefully, I refresh and we get, "MATH STILL WORKS!".

Now if I put something else after here,

console.log, "AFTER CONDITIONAL"

and I'll do one before it as well.

Console.log, "BEFORE" and I save.

I can't, cannot spell, but that's okay.

I refresh. We see all 3.

But if I change this condition to now be,

if 1 plus 2 equals 2, well we know that's false,

we just get before and after.

But I wanna be very clear if this is false,

only the code inside the curly braces does not run.

It doesn't stop everything.

Our code still lives on afterwards.

It's just this stuff doesn't run

and I can have as many lines as needed in here.

So instead of doing if 1 plus 2 equals 2,

why don't we do something more like,

let's pick a random number.

Okay, so Math.random,

remember that gives us a tiny little decimal

between 0 and 1, Math.random.

And let's pretend I'm flipping a coin or something.

So I'm gonna save that Math.random to a variable.

I'll call it let rand or random equal Math.random.

Now I'm not gonna be able to do a comparison with equality.

I mean I could, but a random number

is something crazy like that.

So I'm not gonna be able to say

if random equals that, we'll be here all day.

But what I could do is just say is random less than 0.5.

So if random is less than 0.5, it's between 0 and 1.

So roughly half the time it should be less than 0.5

and the other half it should be greater than.

If that's the case, I'll do something like,

console.log, "YOUR NUMBER IS LESS THAN 0.5!!!", right?

And then I could console.log the number 2.

Why don't we do that,

console.log, I mean our random number,

not the actual digit 2, console.log random.

Alright, and let's just get rid of before and after.

You already saw how that works. Let's refresh, nothing.

So that must mean that our random number

was not less than 0.5.

One more time. Nope. Again, again, I'm still refreshing.

Hey, it finally worked.

Your number is less than 0.5,

we got 0.416, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Try again. Here we go.

Your number is less than 0.5, 0.09. Small one.

Okay. So this is the basic syntax of a conditional.

We can have as many if as we want.

I mean I could do something like this.

If random is greater than 0.5,

should do greater than or equal to technically,

just in case there's that magical chance

that it actually is exactly 0.5.

If that's the case, let's just duplicate this.

Your number is greater than.

Now this seems kind of silly to do it this way and it is.

I'll show you a better way in the next video,

but this will work if I refresh.

Now we get your number is greater than 0.5

and here's the number.

Greater, less, greater and less.

So we have two different ifs,

two things that we're checking,

is random less than 0.5? Do this.

Is it greater? Do this.

Alright, so this is our first piece.

The If Statement, simple enough, hopefully.

We have if and then in parentheses,

something that evaluates to true or false.

We'll see more and more complex stuff

that can go inside of those parens,

but at the end of the day,

they all evaluate to true or false.

A binary Boolean, yes or no.

So next up, another piece of our conditional.

FRIDAYS ARE DECENT, ESPECIALLY AFTER WORK!
You are a child. You pay $10
Instructor: Okay, so that's the if statement.

Next I'm gonna show another piece that we can chain on.

It works in conjunction with an if,

in fact it only works if it's proceeded

by an if it's called the else if.

So you can think of this as if not the first thing.

If the if part was false,

then maybe try this other thing.

Else if, so in this case, once again, it's very,

very stupid to have this variable rating.

I'm setting it to two.

It's kind of redundant to then check if it's three or two.

But imagine it's random

or it's coming from a user or something.

We don't know what it is.

Put your finger over it

and pretend it's not two. (chuckles)

We check if rating is equal to three.

That's false here.

So this does not run,

and we instead move on to this one right here, else if.

So this will only run if the first thing was false.

So only one of them will run.

Let me demonstrate that over here.

Why don't we start with a simpler non-random thing.

So I'm gonna comment this out in VS code.

In case you don't remember,

it's the same shortcut to comment CSS or html.

For me it's command forward slash.

So let's do something involving the days

of the week and strings.

So I'll make a variable here, I'll call it day of week.

I'll use const because I'm not gonna be altering this.

So const day of week equals,

and then I'll start it off as Monday.

All right, which I think most people agree is if you work

a seven or a five day a week, typical schedule,

it's a pretty bad day if you had to pick one.

So we'll add an if, (laughs) if day of week equals Monday.

And if that's the case, we'll console.log,

"Ughhh, I hate Mondays."

All right, so we can just verify that works.

I'll refresh the page.

We get "Ughhh, I hate Mondays."

But there's other days, some that are better,

some that are terrible, let's say Saturday.

If we get a Saturday, I wanna say,

"Yes, I love Saturdays."

So I can do an else if day of week

equals Saturday console.log.

"Yay I love Saturdays."

So notice I put this on the same line

as the closing bracket for my if,

you don't have to do that at all,

it's just a habit that I have.

It's not a bad habit, it's just a style

or a convention that you can follow.

But please by all means don't feel like you have to do that.

All right? So these are linked.

Remember, only one of these will ever run.

Only one console.log will print.

And in this case it's, "Ughhh I hate Mondays."

If I change it to Saturday,

hopefully Saturday, and refresh.

"Yay I love Saturdays."

Now I can chain these together.

I can have as many else ifs as I want.

I just put another else if afterwards,

so I could add another one on here.

I'll duplicate this.

What should I check for Monday is not great.

Saturday, you know, Sunday is good.

Sunday night though, it's a little eh, you know,

people get that Sunday night blues thing going on.

How about Friday?

If day, week, day of week is Friday, we'll go with,

"Fridays are decent,

especially after work!"

All right, so we now have three possible options,

three possible outcomes.

Let's change this to be Friday.

So the first one, not true, it's skipped.

Next one, not true, it's skipped.

And our final one, it is true, we print this out.

So if I have something else like fry daddy, (laughs)

nothing will be printed out,

unless I had some other stuff down here.

So this one seems okay,

it seems hopefully clear enough how this works.

But let me just demonstrate one more example.

I'm gonna comment this out again.

Let's go back to Friday though

just in case you run that yourself.

And let's make a variable called how about age.

And I use this example a lot.

I know it's not very exciting,

but let's say that we're running a,

I don't know, a theme park or something,

and we have different age brackets.

If you're zero to maybe five years old,

you can get in for free.

If you are 5 to 10, you pay a child price,

which will be, I don't know, how about $10.

And then if you are between 10

and what else do we have?

10 and 65, that's considered adult.

And that, I mean, 10 is kind of a weird cutoff,

but nah, whatever. I already committed to it.

So your price is $20,

and then if you get to 65 plus

you're going to be a senior,

and you get in for $10, you get a discount.

Okay, quite a lot there.

So to implement this, if I wanted just a simple conditional,

I'm just gonna comment this out

'cause it's all completely invalid,

but we'll leave it there to follow.

If I had some conditional

or some variable, we'll call it age, const age,

and I'm using const again just 'cause this won't be changing

after I create it, just like with day of the week,

I can alter it here, but it's not gonna be

updated after the fact.

I'm not adding to age.

So age will be about eight to begin with.

So I can start if age is, how do I wanna do this?

If it's less than five, I could start with that.

If age is less than five, console.log,

"You are child." (laughs)

I dunno why I do this in all caps, let's just do,

"You are a child.

You get in for free."

All right, let's verify it doesn't work right

because price or age is eight.

So then can add in my else if,

and this time I can do else if, if you are under 10.

And the reason this works,

remember it's all hinging upon this order.

This code only runs this conditional here will only be

attempted if the first one was false.

So that means if we make it to this point,

we're already guaranteed not to be less than five.

So else if age is less than 10.

This is really saying, all right,

if you're not less than five, are you less than 10?

And for this to be true, you would be between 5 and 10.

Hopefully that makes sense.

I'm trying to demonstrate that these are linked together.

It's not just two things we're testing.

This thing is only tested if this is false.

So console.log, "You are a child."

Oh I think I went with child

and then this is also child.

Why don't I rename this?

"You are a baby. (laughs) You get in for free."

"You are a child. You pay $10."

Okay, and then let's check that out. I'll refresh.

"You are a child. You pay $10."

Let's try it with two years old.

"You are a baby. You get in for free."

Now I can add another one else if age is less than 65,

console.log, "You are an adult.

You pay," and then what did I say? "$20."

All righty, so let's make this how about 34 years old.

Refresh. "You are an adult. You pay 20."

We go back to three, "You're a baby."

So hopefully that demonstrates

how these are linked together, right?

In order for this to be true,

we already know to make it to this point,

this was false and this was false.

So we know for sure age is not less than five.

It's definitely not less than 10.

And then if this is true,

we know all right, well it's somewhere between 10 and 65.

So the order matters, at least with the way

I've set this up right now.

But I'm shortly gonna show you some other options

for how we could rewrite this.

But really my point I wanted to make clear right now

is it's just that these are linked.

If you use an else if, it's gotta come after an if,

or it could come after another else if,

and they are sequential.

So this thing is tried.

Is that true? Well then we're done.

We just completely leave this whole chunk.

If it's not true, we try this.

And if that's not true, we try this.

We could have as many as we want.

I could've had seven different ones

for each day of the week,

but I just didn't wanna waste your time with that.

All right, so next up we'll see another piece

to our conditional, the final piece, which is else.

BEFORE CONDITIONAL1
MATH STILL WORKS!
AFTER CONDITIONAL1
BEFORE CONDITIONAL2
MATH STILL WORKS!
AFTER CONDITIONAL2
YOUR NUMBER IS LESS THAN 0.5
0.35525360653934146
UGHH I HATE MONDAYS!
You are senior. You pay $10
Instructor: All right, so let's revisit

this day of the week thing from earlier here.

const dayOfWeek = 'Friday';

and then I'm checking if it's Monday,

if it's Saturday, or if it's Friday.

Now we've got a whole bunch of other days

and let's say for each of the other days.

so if (dayOfWeek === 'Tuesday')

I want to console.log('MEH')

like meh, not a great day.

And then I wanna do the same thing for every other day.

So that leaves us, let's see,

we've got Monday, Tuesday,

I've got Wednesday,

which I can never, Wednesday.

Is that right? Oh boy.

And then we've got Thursday and then Sunday.

Well, you know, Sunday's not really meh,

but if I wanted to, I could put that in here too.

They all have the same outcome.

This seems a bit redundant, it's not redundant,

but it seems unnecessary and that's because it is.

There is a better way of doing this.

But just to show what I mean, right?

I have Thursday of as the day of the week,

we get, MEH,

if I have Tuesday as the day of the week,

we get a big fat MEH.

So it would be great if I could combine them.

They're kind of the otherwise the last case, right?

I'm checking singling out Monday, Saturday, and Friday.

Everything else I just wanna print out MEH.

So we have a way of doing that.

It is the else statement.

It's part of our conditional here.

So else is going to be the last part.

If you have an else, you don't have to,

but if you do, it's the last piece

of the entire conditional.

And we don't specify any condition.

We don't have parentheses.

It's simply a catchall.

It's going to run as the last thing.

If nothing else matched first,

if nothing else was true along this journey, then do this.

Think of it as just, if nothing else was true, do this.

All right, I'm here.

If nothing else was true, I'm gonna run.

But if anything was true along the way,

then our conditional is done.

We never hit that else.

So here I'm using it.

In this case rating = -99.

I'm checking, is it 3? Nope.

else if 2? Nope.

else if rating is 1? No.

And then instead of having else if 0 and -1

and -2 in every possible option,

I can simply add else.

If it's anything else,

then print out INVALID RATING!

So I could rewrite what I have right here.

Instead of doing Tuesday, Wednesday,

Thursday and singling them out.

I can simply do else.

It's just a catchall,

console.log("MEH")

so I don't have to specify if it's equal to Tuesday

and Wednesday and Thursday.

I don't need that at all.

I'm simply saying otherwise.

So now we still get MEH, right?

I can make it Tuesday.

You know, I could even prompt a user if I wanted to.

prompt('ENTER A DAY')

Now, one thing to consider is that I have these uppercased,

so we'll need a user to either enter it uppercase.

So here it's prompting me.

I'll enter Monday uppercased or capitalized,

I'll refresh again.

Let's do Wednesday, I get MEH.

Refresh again, I'll do Friday.

FRIDAYS ARE DECENT, ESPECIALLY AFTER WORK!

Now one thing that is, it's not problematic,

but to be aware of, I can type anything in here

and I'll get MEH.

So we're not checking to see if it's, you know,

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

if it's a valid day of the week.

I'm just looking to see if it's Monday, Saturday, Friday,

or literally anything else.

It could be zero and I'm still gonna get MEH.

So keep that in mind.

And another way we could improve that is

by downcasing everything or by uppercasing everything.

So we can eliminate any user capitalization.

so we know how to do that.

.to, let's do .toLowerCase();

So whatever the user enters,

they might type Monday like this for some reason,

we're gonna lowercase it

and we'll end up with all lowercase monday.

And then we can compare that to all lowercase right here.

So saturday lowercase, friday,

we're sort of getting everything on a level playing field.

We're neutralizing all of the capitalization.

And we could go the other way.

We could capitalize everything and make it all caps.

So now I should be able to type in MONday like that

and still see, UGHHH I HATE MONDAYS!

or fridAy in all lowercase, except for a capital A.

FRIDAYS ARE DECENT.

Okay, so that's the basic concept of else,

it's a catchall, it's a little bit,

it's not a great use here,

because we're not ensuring

that your day of the week is valid, right?

You could type zero or pink or something.

The other thing I'll show you

is how we could rewrite this here.

Here, this is kind of silly,

to check if one number is less than 0.5,

do this and then just right afterwards check if

that exact same number is greater than or equal to 0.5.

Well it's only one of these, right?

It's either or in this situation.

So I could simplify this whole thing by deleting that if,

and then just adding my else right here.

Console.log("YOUR NUMBER IS GREATER THAN 0.5!!!")

Right?

If it's not less than,

technically, I guess your number is greater

or equal is possible, than 0.5.

So I don't need that second if statement, right?

These are links, it's only one or the other.

And then if I really wanted to do this nicely,

so I could print the random in both places

or what's nicer is just to print the random

after the fact so that I don't have to duplicate that code.

I want it to happen no matter what.

So only one of these runs and then this always runs.

So let's see what we get.

Gotta refresh my page here.

YOUR NUMBER IS LESS THAN 0.5!!!

LESS, LESS, GREATER.

There we go. LESS.

So it's just either or.

But that's not always the case as we've seen.

We can have as many else ifs as we want.

We don't have to even have an else.

You can just have an if on its own.

You can have an if and an else if,

but if you want to catch all, we can use an else.

So I could update this code here for our age.

Comment this out,

where we're checking for a user's age

or somebody's age.

And I have a couple of options.

So right now I'm saying,

if you're greater than 65, you're an adult.

And then I could do else anything else.

We'll say console.log("You are a senior. You pay $10")

Okay?

Now we technically have a small issue here,

which is that age could be super, super massive.

It could be 55,000 kajillion billion.

Not a real number, but it could be 500, right?

And it's gonna hit this else,

but we can worry about that later.

So let's do 89.

Refresh the page.

You are a senior. You pay $10.

So yes, we're still not accounting

for every possible situation, right?

Our age could be,

I mean technically right now you could have a negative age

and it's still going to trigger this right here

because -100 is less than 5.

You are a baby. You get in for free!

But we'll learn how to tighten these things up.

You know, there's a lot we could do.

First of all, we're not even checking if age is a number,

then we're also, you know, allowing super large ages.

You could have 890 and you'll still be considered a senior.

We can have very tiny ages here, considered a baby.

This is kind of silly in the first place,

but we'll see better ways of combining logic together

to make more complicated statements.

But the core mechanic here of having an if

and then optional else ifs

and an optional else at the end,

that is never going to change.

So, just to be very clear, we can have an if on its own,

we can have an if and then an else.

We can have an if and then else ifs.

We can have an if with else if and then an else.

In all cases, if we ever have an else,

it comes at the end, just a pure else.

It's the last thing.

And if we ever have an else if it must come

after the initial if or another else if

so I could have something like this.

So I don't know if that was at all,

that might have just confused you more,

but we always have an if at a bare minimum,

if we're going to have any sort of conditional,

there's gotta be an if we can't have an else on its own

or an else if.

They are relative to our first if.

then we can just have an if else

for a yes or no sort of binary, this or that.

We can have 10 else ifs and then an else at the end.

Anyway, I think that's, hopefully that's clear.

We'll get a lot of practice with this stuff.

So that's the basics of making decisions.

Now what we're going to add on are just fancier stuff

inside of those parentheses.

There's a lot more that we can do in there,

other than just checking to see if one thing is greater than

or one thing is equal to another.

We can start chaining things together

and adding more complicated logic.

PASSWORD TOO SHORT! Must be 6+ characters
Instructor: Next up, we don't have any new syntax.

I just wanna show you a really important concept,

which is that we can nest conditionals

inside other conditionals.

So, I've got two requirements here for our little demo.

We're going to ask a user for a password.

So, enter a password.

And we don't know how to connect an HTML form

with JavaScripts and all of that

so we're gonna use prompt.

So let's make a variable.

Const, once again, it's not going to change,

so it's fine to use const.

Const, let's do password or user input equals prompt.

Please enter a new password.

Something like that, all right?

And then these are the two requirements.

I need the password to be at least six characters.

So we can do that part pretty simply.

And then I wanna make sure it does not include a space.

So hopefully we know how to do both of these.

You may not remember exactly how to do this one.

We could check if there's a space inside of the string

by using index of.

That's one option.

That would be probably the simplest.

And then to check the length,

well we can just use the length property.

So let's begin there.

Password must be six plus characters.

So we can do password dot length

and we want that to be greater than or equal to six, right?

So let's just do an if.

If password dot length is greater than or equal to six,

then, well we can put something here if we want,

we can do a console dot log, long enough password.

And then we could have an else right here.

Console dot log password too short.

Must be six plus characters, right?

Okay, so we can begin with that.

Let me just make sure everything else

is commented out in here.

Let's execute this.

Please enter a new password.

Let's do, I don't know, cat.

Password too short!

Must be 6+ characters.

Let's refresh.

Enter a new password.

How about just gibberish?

Long enough password!

Great.

Okay, so now let's work on the second part.

Password cannot include space.

So I could just add this down here

as a separate conditional.

I could do this.

If, well, let me keep the comment there.

There we go.

If password.

And then after that we could do,

just to refresh your memory how this works.

We have a string like hello dot index of,

and then I check to see if an H is in there, right?

It's gonna give me the index zero.

But if I look for something that's not in there,

like a space, it gives me negative one.

So we want the password to have an index

of space of negative one.

We want that negative one.

That means there is no space.

Okay?

So what we can do is do that down here.

If password dot index of,

and then space equals,

triple equals negative one.

If that's the case, we can console dot log.

I mean what, what should we console dot log?

You don't have a space, good job.

Good job, no space.

Else, console dot log,

password cannot contain spaces.

All right, so totally separate conditional.

And let's see what happens.

So I'm gonna hit enter or refresh the page, rather.

Enter my password with no space.

So I'll make sure it's long enough.

How about that?

It says long enough password and good job, no space.

Now let's try one that is not long enough like cats.

All right, password too short.

But we're also getting good job, no space.

One more time, I'm gonna have a long password

with a space in it.

Long enough password.

Password cannot contain spaces.

So right now I have two totally separate pieces of logic.

but really if this was a real website,

which it's obviously not even close to being,

but if it were, we usually just give the user

one piece of feedback at a time.

Here's one problem, right.

We're not gonna say good job on this and bad job on this.

We're probably just gonna say

password cannot contain spaces.

And then we'll say good job or you know,

valid password or something if both of these are valid.

So if the password's long enough

and the password does not contain a space.

so I can nest this.

I could say if password dot length

is greater than equal to six,

if that's the case, let's not just print something out,

let's check to see if there is a space or not.

So I can copy this and just put it right there.

So now this code only runs to even check if there's a space,

if the password is long enough.

If the password's not long enough,

we immediately print that out, too short.

If it is long enough, we look for a space.

And now instead of saying good job, no space,

we'll probably say something like valid password.

If we make it to this point right here,

it means this was true

because that's the only way we get to this code.

And then this has to be true to make it

to this line right there.

The only way that happens is if line 50 and 48

both evaluate to true.

If anything goes wrong along the way,

we either hit this one or this one,

depending on what the issue is.

So let's try it now.

Let's enter a valid password.

How about butterfly?

Valid password.

And how about one that is long enough but contains spaces

or just one space.

Password cannot contain spaces.

Okay, so this is working,

but it's a little bit clunky, having to manage this nesting.

Not that nesting is necessarily bad,

but really what we care about is

if the password's long enough and

it does not contain spaces.

And there's another way that we could combine this logic,

because that's basically what we're doing here.

We're combining this logic by nesting it.

But there's another way

that we'll see coming up very shortly.
