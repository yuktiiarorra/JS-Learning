    Narrator: So while we're talking about while loops,

I should also introduce the break keyword.

The break keyword is most commonly used with while loops,

although technically you can use it with other loops.

It's just really, really rare.

And what it will do is inside of a loop,

if it ever actually runs,

so with some condition in this case,

if the guessed number is equal to a random target number,

if they're the same, we break out

and that is going to stop the execution

of the loop immediately, as soon as break is encountered.

And then code just resumes running after our loop.

So whatever is down here, if anything, would be executed.

So let me show this with a simple loop.

We'll do a while(true) as well, while(true).

And I'm not gonna run this,

otherwise we'll have a bad time

if it's just constantly running.

And we're going to make a really annoying program, I guess,

where whatever you type, let's say I type hello,

our computer, the code is just gonna repeat exactly

what I said back to me, hello.

And then if I type something else, it's gonna repeat it

to me and the only way to get out of it is by typing

maybe quit or stop copying me or something.

Let's do "stop copying me".

All right, so I'm gonna start

by asking a user to enter something.

I'll do, let input = prompt,

("Hey, say something!"),

and then in here, I'm simply going to spit that back out.

So I'm gonna prompt the user again using that input,

so whatever we captured here,

and then save that back to input.

So basically I'm just, you know,

the very first time, hey, say something.

Let's say enter hello, then we're going to prompt hello.

That will be the argument to prompt.

And then we'll capture that value,

whatever I say that time, goodbye or I hate you or haha,

that will be saved in input and the process repeats.

And if I ran this right now, it would be an infinite loop.

But I can check in here if (input),

let's just say if it equals stop bopying, "stop copying me",

just like that,

if that's the case, we can break out

of the loop and down here

I'll put something like console.log("OK YOU WIN!"),

just like that.

So if this is ever encountered, the loop will stop running

and this code runs or whatever comes afterwards.

The only other thing, I guess we can make this

.toLowerCase maybe, just so that I don't

have to type it perfectly.

Stop copying me, let's see if it works.

Oh boy, also, actually while I'm here,

I could just put this break on the same line.

It's such a short bit of code that I'm running

inside of this conditional.

So I would just do that, just like that.

All right, I'm gonna refresh, say something, hello,

and it says hello back to me.

Lol, bye,

it's gonna keep going forever

until I type stop copying me and we're done.

And if I open up the console, we see OK YOU WIN!

But that only showed up here,

you'll have to trust me on that,

once I hit that break right here.

So while(true) seems like it should happen forever

and it would if not for break.

It's a way of escaping a loop.

While we're here, I guess I could show, you know,

for, let's do a for loop,

(let i = 0; i <),

let's do (1,000; i ++)

console.log(i).

And that would just go to 1,000,

which is not really a big deal

to print out all of those numbers.

I can just show that here.

Let's move this over.

There we go.

Oh, it doesn't go to 1,000.

I can't do math, but we get to 999.

But in here, if I do something like if,

let's do it afterwards,

if (i ===),

what should we do, if (i === 100) break.

So it will work in here.

It's just kind of odd to do it in a for loop

because most frequently we use break in a situation

where something is not running a set number of times.

We don't know how much something needs to run for.

Otherwise we would just make our loop run.

You know, in this case, if we're going from 0 to 100,

let's just write our loop to go from 0 to 100.

Why do this weird structure?

But I just wanted to show that we can.

So that's the break keyword.
