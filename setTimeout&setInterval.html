    <!-- Instructor: So next up we're gonna

take a look at two functions

that expect you to pass a callback function in.

But they are not array methods.

They have nothing to do with arrays, they have to do

with delaying or waiting, pausing execution

and postponing execution for a later date.

We're basically scheduling something.

So the first one we'll look at is called setTimeout.

And before I show you that, I just wanna explain

how this would work in some other programming languages.

Imagine you have something

like you're printing some string, okay, "hello...".

And then you want to wait three seconds

before you print hello again.

Or you know, maybe you'll print something

like are you still there?

Okay, so this is not JavaScript.

This would be closer to something like Python or Ruby.

Print, "are you still there?"

And if I wanna wait in between, in some languages it's

as simple as sleep for 3000 milliseconds

or pause for 3000 milliseconds.

I mean it depends on the specifics of the language,

but there are specific functions that you can call

that just stop execution.

Nothing happens until this finishes.

Well in JavaScript we don't quite

have the same interface, we can print,

"are you still there" after three seconds.

But it's a little bit clunkier and we'll go into why

and sort of the mechanics of this,

when we talk about asynchronous JavaScript,

we have a whole designated section on it later in the course

for now, I'm just showing it as an example of callbacks.

So the first function, as I mentioned,

is called setTimeout.

And it expects you to pass two things in.

First, a callback, second, a number of milliseconds

to delay the execution of the function.

So here's how it works, setTimeout.

And you can see VS Code is

explaining the two expected arguments,

a timer handler, a function basically,

and then a timeout number, how long something should take

or how long the delay should be.

So I'm gonna pass in a simple function,

I'll do an arrow function to keep it simple.

Console.log, "HELLO!!!"

Okay, and then the second argument.

So this is the first argument.

The second one is gonna be a number of milliseconds.

I'll do 3000. So three seconds.

If I refresh my page now where I've included this script,

we wait three seconds and we get "HELLO!!!"

So that's kind of all there is to set time out,

it's just gonna run one time.

After this number of milliseconds,

it will execute this function.

So we have to pass in a callback.

Otherwise you know, if we just passed in console.log

for example, that's just gonna execute right away.

That's gonna break things.

The whole point is that JavaScript is going to wait,

the browser will wait to call whatever this function is

until the appropriate time.

So if I wanted to do something like, you know,

print "HELLO!!!" first and then

after three seconds do something like,

"...are you still there?"

So I'll do "HELLO!!!"

and then three seconds later, "...are you still there?"

And just to show you this, if I put something else

after it, console.log, you know, "GOODBYE!!"

This is going to run immediately.

So this will run, this runs or the setTimeout is called,

but it doesn't call this function until three seconds later.

So it just keeps going and it prints "GOODBYE!!"

and then three seconds later this function will run.

So let's refresh the page.

You can see "HELLO!!!" "GOODBYE!!" both there immediately

and then three seconds later, "...are you still there?"

Okay, so that's setTimeout.

Another option or another function,

pretty similar is called setInterval.

And setInterval will call a function that we pass in.

It will call a callback every X number of milliseconds.

So we can repeat something at an interval.

I'll show you an example.

Let's do something like if we console.log, just Math.random.

'Cause if we console.log the same thing every time,

Chrome just sort of collapses it

so you don't actually see it as a separate line.

But if I do Math.random, it'll just be a random decimal.

And if I call setInterval

and then pass in a function, arrow function

or not, doesn't matter.

And then I specify an interval, let's do every two seconds.

So 2000 milliseconds, exact same signature

as setTimeout, pass in our function.

And then comma second argument number of milliseconds.

What you'll see after two seconds is

that it continues over and over

and over to call that function.

So this is not as commonly used,

but there are definitely situations when you want

to do something at an interval.

Now one thing that's important to know is how to stop it.

So I actually said we were gonna see two functions,

we're actually gonna see three.

But the function I'm gonna show you

right now is very straightforward.

It's called clear interval.

And all that we need

to do is actually save the return value of setInterval.

Every time we call it, it gives us an id,

it returns the ID corresponding

to whatever interval we set up.

So there we could have like five

or six, seven, a whole bunch

of these different setInterval function calls

running at different intervals.

And we can specify which one we want to stop

by using this id.

So if I save that ID, just call it const id.

I'm gonna refresh the page.

If we look at id, it's just set to 1

for this particular interval.

But if I call setInterval again, I'll get a different id.

So now what I can do is call clear interval

and then pass in that ID and it should stop and it does.

So not as commonly used,

but it's definitely worth knowing.

And if you're going to know setInterval,

you should definitely know clear interval

so you don't have something just going forever

while the page is open.

Now if you close page, it's not like you're, you know,

the browser just keeps printing that until the end of time.

But as long as the window's open you're going

to be printing a lot.

Okay, so that's it.

Set time out to something we will learn more about.

It will play a pretty pivotal role

in our async JavaScript section,

but for now it just serves as another illustration

of passing functions to other functions.

So we pass that function in.

It's not called right away, it's called

after X number of milliseconds.

Same thing here, pass the function in

and pass in an interval.

The only difference is that setInterval will repeatedly

call my function at that interval

and then it returns an ID that we can use to clear it.

So I'll just put that down here, clear interval

and then we'll pass that ID in.

But if I ran this right away,

we won't see our console.logs occur.

So I'll leave it commented out.

Okay, that is pretty much it for setTimeout and setInterval.
