    <!-- Instructor: Next up, we get to spread,

which is one of my favorite of the newer features

in JavaScript.

Unfortunately,

it's a little bit hard to explain all in one go

because it's actually used in multiple situations.

It's kind of like a Swiss Army knife in JavaScript.

So the official, well, this isn't official,

but the definition from MDN at least, is that:

"Spread syntax allows an iterable,

such as an array, to be expanded in places where zero

or more arguments for function calls

or elements for array literals are expected,

or an object expression to be expanded

in places where zero or more key-value pairs

for object literals are expected."

Do you get that?

Do you even need this video anymore?

I feel like that's just a great explanation,

we don't even need examples.

But really, it's a lot to take in.

But the main thing that hopefully you can tell

from this definition is the phrase expanding,

or just the word expanding,

that's really the key, the idea of spread.

We're taking something and spreading it out.

Now, what we're spreading that iterable into

is where the variation comes in.

So the first example we'll see

is spreading an array or an iterable

into a function call, into separate arguments.

So let me demo this first.

Over in the console,

there's this function,

I mean, it doesn't exist just in the console,

but Math.max.

And max is expecting separate arguments,

just values, and it's going to tell us

the maximum value here.

So it could take 10, 2, 50, 100 arguments,

it will find the maximum.

We also have Math.min, which works the same way,

except it shows us the minimum.

So I can have,

let's just do it with three arguments this time.

The minimum is one.

So, it takes as many arguments as we want,

which is a bit different than most of the functions

and built-in methods we've seen

where there's a very distinct,

you know, you pass this one argument,

or maybe two, or maybe one is optional.

Anyway, now let's say that I have an array,

and this array contains a bunch of numbers,

in fact, it contains all of these numbers.

So I'm going to save that here.

const nums equals, that array of numbers right there.

Now, I want to find the maximum or the min using Math.max.

So if I try and pass that in,

just like that, I'm going to get not a number.

Because it doesn't know what to do,

we just passed in a single array full of numbers.

It's anticipating separate arguments,

each one being a number.

So, what I can do is use the spread syntax,

which is three dots,

to spread this array into separate arguments.

So that looks like this: Math.max,

and then instead of just nums,

I'm going to do ... before.

And that's the equivalent of this right here.

So that entire array is going to be spread out

into separate arguments, first argument,

second argument, third argument.

You can think of it as just removing those array brackets.

So it doesn't actually change nums in any way,

it's simply the act of passing it in to max, Math.max.

We're spreading it,

we're separating it into separate arguments,

as that happens.

So we could do the same thing for min,

Math.min(...nums),

and we get one, that's the minimum value in that array.

Here's another example.

console.log, we've seen takes as many arguments as we want.

I can pass them in separately with commas.

I mean, this is useless and meaningless,

but if I do that, they're each printed,

and they're separated by a space.

So if I do console.log on my entire nums array,

this is what we get.

The array itself is printed.

But if I spread that, just like that right there,

it's a slight difference,

at least what we see printed out,

but it's actually a very significant difference

in that each element from this array

is passed in as a separate argument to console.log.

So there are all separated by spaces.

Now, I can actually do this with things that aren't arrays,

there are other iterables, as we've talked about.

Anything that we can iterate over with four of,

like strings, I can also spread into a function call.

So, if I console.log the string hello,

it just prints out one thing, hello, nothing crazy.

But if I spread that, one, two, three,

it's going to spread each individual character

into a separate argument.

And so we end up with this.

Again, it doesn't seem all that crazy,

it doesn't seem very different,

we're just getting a space between each letter.

But that is how console.log works.

It's what happens if we had called this right here.

h, e, l, I won't do the whole thing,

but you can see that's where those spaces come from

when we pass in separate arguments.

And that's exactly what happened.

This individual, monolithic string

was passed in as separate characters,

separate individual arguments.

Same thing here with the array nums,

it was passed in as separate standalone arguments.

So that's one situation where we spread an iterable

into a function call.

Next up, we'll see some other uses for spread.
Instructor: Next up, we'll talk

about the second piece here.

Spread syntax allows an iterable such as an array

to be expanded in places where zero or more elements

for array literals are expected.

Basically how we can spread an iterable into arrays.

So what this looks like is something like this.

Here I have two arrays, cats and dogs.

Both Rusty and Wyatt, my previous dogs.

Rest in peace, guys,

and I want to make a a third array,

I'll call this Pets or allPets,

and I wanted to contain everything from cats

and everything from dogs.

And imagine these are actually hundreds of elements long,

so it'd be a lot of work for me to type that out myself.

The easiest thing to do is use the Spread operator.

There are other options, right?

We've seen how we can copy

pieces of an array using things like Slice,

but we're not gonna do that here

because Spread allows us to spread

an iterable like an array like this cats array

into, in this case, a new array.

So if we take a look at allPets,

it looks just like cats, right?

But they are not the same, it's a copy.

So if I change one of them, allPets.push, whatever that is,

allPets changes, but cats is unchanged.

So we did actually copy the contents over using Spread

and I can combine arrays,

so I could do this.

Cats and dogs just like that,

and now allPets is the result

of copying over everything from the cats array

and everything from the dog's array

and we have now very easily combined them

into a third new array.

So if I change the order,

just to be clear here, dogs, cats,

that impacts the eventual order we get

when Spread finishes doing its thing.

And I could also add my own stuff in there too.

I could do dogs, comma, cats, comma.

I don't know, let's say I have a pet turtle named Speedy.

Speedy is added to the end there.

I could add whatever I want in here.

At the beginning, I can put some numbers.

Doesn't make sense, but I can.

So Spread is working the same way that we saw earlier

where we're spreading an array into a function call,

except we're not spreading it into a function call.

We're spreading an array into another array

or we're spreading two arrays into a third.

We're combining things, we're copying things.

So if I just wanted a direct copy,

often you'll see this,

just a spread like that.

If I wanna combine, we do something like that

and I can add on as we've seen.

I can put other stuff in there,

and remember that we're not limited to working with arrays.

We have other iterable like strings.

So I could take the string "hello"

and put it in an array just like that

or if I wanted to,

I could spread it into a new array.

Just like what we saw with console.log

when I spread a string, each element

or in this case, each character of the string

is spread into its own element in an array.

So that's all there is to using Spread

in the context of an array literal.

Next up, we'll talk about objects.


-: The third and final situation

where we use spread is in object literals.

So instead of curly braces, we use this

to copy properties from one object into a new object.

So we can combine objects, we can make a new object

based upon an old one, we can copy one, we can tweak one.

That's kind of the main idea here.

Just like what we saw with arrays,

where we can copy elements from one array into a new array,

we can spread properties from an object into a new object.

So, as an example, I've got these two objects here,

feline and canine.

And actually, they both have a family property in common.

Family: 'Felidae,' Family: 'Caninae.'

I don't know, I never took Latin.

Anyway, if I wanted to make a copy, a new object,

using one of these-- so I'm just gonna do it over here

to start-- I can do something like this.

Feline. That just makes me a copy.

So, brand new object with the same properties

as the original feline.

But I can also add on, so I can do feline.

And then actually, I wanna add in a property called...

I don't know, how about "color."

Which will be black, sure.

And that makes me a new object

with the properties from feline copied over,

or spread, into this new object, and color set to black.

So, we could combine the two, feline and canine,

into a new object called "catDog,"

if you ever saw that show, animated show,

Nickelodeon show in the 90s or 2000s.

Anyway, I want to combine feline and canine.

So I'm gonna do spread, feline, and then spread, canine.

So this is going to copy over properties from both.

But remember, there is a conflict.

They both have a family property,

and in that case, the order matters.

So feline will be copied over first, and then canine.

So when there's a conflict, canine is going to win,

quote unquote, because it comes second,

and it overwrites family.

So if I switch that order up and just did it this way,

canine... and then feline, comma, like that,

we end up with family set to Felidae.

Okay.

And then if I actually wrote something else in here,

like family is actually set to Steele family,

then that's actually the winner, because it comes last.

Okay.

So, that's kind of the basic idea

of copying objects using spread.

It's just gonna take the properties

that key valued pairs from one

and add them into the new object.

Also, sometimes I get asked about this,

I can't imagine there's many situations you would need

to do this, but if you try and spread an array

into an object-- so let's have the array 2, 4, 6, 8.

And I'll try spreading that into an object,

so dot, dot, dot.

What do you expect to see?

What's the key and what's the value?

The indices are used as the key,

so at index 0 we have 2, 1 we have 4.

2 we have 6, and 3 we have 8.

Same thing with strings, if we try and spread a string,

HIII... well, that one sucks, but sure.

We have a lot of Is. It's just the index.

So, not common, but it is a thing you can do.

Now, what do we use this for? Why do we spread into objects?

Well, a lot of the time, we'll use it

when we're creating copies of an object,

which is something you actually do a lot,

especially if you're working with libraries

and tools like React.

That's a whole big topic we're not gonna get

into at the moment, but there are valid reasons

why you copy objects a lot rather than mutating them.

Another situation, though-- imagine I have some data,

let's say it's coming from a form.

Some data from a user.

And I want to take that email, blueman@gmail.password,

that username, tfunke, and I wanna combine it

into a new object with some additional information.

Suppose this represents a user registering

for my website.

This is all a user needs to provide,

but I also want to add in an ID,

like their unique identifier, and maybe an

isAdmin variable set to true or false,

or property, rather, not a variable.

So I can create a copy, I could do--

copy everything over from datafromForm,

that's the name of this object,

and then I'm gonna add an ID, let's say it's set

to that right there, isAdmin is gonna be false.

So these are things not coming from the form, right?

This is just coming from me.

And then I'm gonna save this to a variable,

const newUser, like that, and we'll take a look

at it over here, newUser.

And there we are.

So, we took the data from the form,

the fake form data, and then I added on my own stuff,

ID and isAdmin.

So, just one situation, sort of to illustrate

why you might wanna know this,

why it could be useful in the future.

So that wraps up spread, there's a lot to it,

but at the end of the day, it has

to do with spreading one source

of information into some destination,

whether that's spreading arrays or iterables

into function arguments, or spreading arrays

or iterables into actual array literals,

or spreading objects into objects.

It all has to do with spreading,

I guess that goes without saying.

All right, next up, we're gonna talk about rest. -->
