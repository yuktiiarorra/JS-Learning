208. Todo List Project CodeAlong
Transcript
Instructor: Okay, so let's go ahead and make our files

before we can begin.

I've made the basic HTML file.

Nothing crazy.

We've got, you know, our basic boilerplate,

and then some text, or an H1 rather,

and then a UL that just explains the commands.

Again, not necessary, but just a reminder to us (laughs)

and I guess hypothetical users

that probably will never exist of how the app works.

So I've got that done.

Now I'm gonna make a file.

I'll call this maybe todos.js.

And I'll include a script.

And I'm gonna do source equals todos.js.

Okay, there we are.

So this should include my script.

Let's make sure it works.

If I put maybe an alert in here.

I always just like to, you know, test out that connection.

So, now I'm gonna head over to my browser.

I have the file open.

I'm just gonna refresh.

And we get the alerts.

Okay, good news.

So now, we basically need to implement everything.

So why don't we start with the basic game loop, if you will,

this while loop that continues to ask

over and over and over, just to jog your memory, right,

this is the solution.

What would you like to do?

It's just gonna keep asking me.

Let's just keep entering gibberish.

And then the one thing it knows is quit.

So if I enter, quit,

if that's the case we print out, you quit the app,

and we stop bothering you, we stop asking.

So to do that,

basically we'll want some form of a while loop, right?

And while something is not equal to quit.

Now what is that something going to be?

Well, let's start by asking a user to enter, you know,

let's prompt them,

what would you like to do?

And then save that to a variable.

And I'm gonna use let, not const,

because I will be updating this variable.

So let, what should we, maybe just input?

And then here we'll say, while input

is not equal to quit,

we will just continuously ask you.

So I'm gonna say, you know, input equals prompt,

what would you like to do?

So in other words,

at the very beginning, ask one time,

what would they like to do?

Now if they happen to type "quit" as the first thing,

then we're just done.

But if they enter anything else,

ask them again and again and again and again,

and then at the end,

let's do something like,

okay, quit the app or something.

I don't remember what we actually printed out over here.

What was it?

You quit the app.

All right, close enough.

So let's see what happens.

What would you like to do?

Just typing in anything.

But as soon as I type quit,

hopefully, should open the console.

There we are.

We see quit the app.

Okay, next step.

Let's quickly check to see if input is,

basically we want to quit if you type the letter Q.

So how would I do that?

Well, with what we have right here,

while input is not equal to quit, the string,

I could add on another condition, but what would it be?

Basically I want to keep running this code

while you have not entered quit,

and you have not entered Q.

So that can be confusing

because we're doing a while loop with not equality, right,

this loop runs as long as you don't enter this,

some people might think, oh, we want Or

While your input is not quit or your input is not Q,

but that's not the case.

We only want this loop to run.

This is the, you know, continuing to bother you

and ask you questions.

We want to keep asking you questions,

as long as your previous input was not quit,

and it was also not Q.

If it was either one, then we're done.

So I'm gonna do and input is not equal to Q.

Okay.

So let's see if that works.

Refresh the page, let's type Q, and we're done.

Try it one more time.

I type quit.

Oh boy, this is what happens

when I have a mic in my face and I can't see the keyboard.

(laughing) There we go.

Okay, quit the app.

So next step, let's implement the adding a to-do

and listing a to-do feature.

So first we need a place to store the to-dos.

Now I'm gonna make a to-dos list, specifically an array.

So I'm gonna use const, as we've talked about,

it's most common with arrays.

So const to-dos

equals empty array.

Or to help us out,

let's just put something in there to begin with.

How about collect eggs?

And let's just do one more.

Collect chicken eggs and

how about clean cat litter box?

So just litter box,

put whatever you want in here, obviously.

Okay, so now that we have two to-dos in there,

why don't we focus on listing the to-dos,

and remember how this is supposed to work.

We list the to-dos,

or just list the one, the default.

We have this console.log, that's easy,

but then we also have the index that we're printing out

because we use that when we delete something.

So it's nice to show the user that index.

So let's implement List,

let's, you know, add some logic in here,

so that when a user types List as their input

so that would be in the loop.

Instead of just asking them, what would you like to do?

First we're gonna check,

well, what if their input was exactly equal to list?

Also, you know what,

this is sort of a silly thing to point out,

but I'm realizing I'm being sloppy

with mixing double and single quotes.

Personally, I like to use single quotes

or at least I need to be consistent.

I don't have to but style wise I like it.

So I'm just gonna quickly change that.

Okay, so where was I?

Yes, if the input that a user types

is equal to the string list,

what do we want to do?

Well, why don't we just start by recognizing it,

you know, console.log,

maybe just the stars to begin with.

So just a list of stars, a list, a string of asterisks,

just like that.

So let's just make sure we can see that

if I do type list.

So I'll type something that's not list,

I'll type list,

okay, and then I'll quit.

So now what we actually wanna do is print out each to-do

from the to-dos array.

But I also want the index.

So a for of loop, unfortunately, is not gonna work for me.

What I'm going to use instead is a for loop,

a regular old for loop.

So how do we loop over the array?

For, I'll use I,

starting at index zero,

while it's less than todos.length.

Add one more to I each time.

So we start at index zero

and then we keep looping, incrementing I,

until we hit the highest index in the array,

and we stop before we hit the length of the array.

Because remember, you know this array is a length of two,

but the highest index is one, 01.

Okay?

So then we'll print out a string.

And the easiest option I think is a string template literal.

So we'll show I.

And then a colon.

And then the actual to-do.

Well how do I get the to-do?

I use the index.

Todos, square bracket, I.

Just a quick note,

later on we'll see another option

for how we could achieve this,

where we want the to-do itself, the string and the index,

there's a method built into arrays called For Each.

So if you know about that, that is one option,

but I'm not gonna show it now,

but we'll get to it and you'll see what I'm talking about

in a couple of sections.

Okay?

So let's see what happens now,

does it actually work how it's supposed to?

Let's do list.

Looks good to me.

And then quit.

So now let's implement new,

so I can make a new to-do.

We'll just add in another conditional, a check.

We'll do an else if

input is equal to new.

Just like that.

What we're going to-do is prompt the user again,

and this time ask them for their new to-do.

So I'll use const,

because we're only gonna ask them one time, right?

The reason I use let here for input

is that we're reassigning input over and over and over.

So I'll use const.

So const new todo, probably, is what I would call this,

or new text or something.

Yeah, new todo, equals prompt.

And we'll do something like, okay, what is the new to-do?

And then we'll take that result, which will be a string

and we'll just add that on to the to-dos array.

Now how do we do that? We use push.

That's one option.

Todos.push, newToDo.

And then I like to provide some basic feedback.

So let's do a simple console.log.

On the solution,

if I type new, I enter new to-do, okay,

it says blah blah blah, added to list.

So let's do that. Let's print that out.

String template literal, new to-do,

added to the list.

Just like that.

Okay, let's see if it works.

I'll refresh the page. Let's do a new.

Okay, what is the new to-do?

How about walk the dog?

Walk the dog added to the list.

Now let's actually type list and there it is.

Okay, let's do one more, walk the cats.

Show them all with list, walk the cats is there.

Okay, so now all we have left is delete.

So we'll just do another else if

input equals delete.

Now this is the the most annoying one to-do

because first of all, we need to ask,

what are you trying to delete?

So we'll use prompts.

We'll call this index, prompt,

okay, what is the index,

or enter an index.

Enter an index to delete.

Great, let's just make sure we see that.

And then I'm gonna console.log the index.

Okay, so I'll refresh the page, lemme quit, refresh.

Let's list and then let's do a delete.

Make sure we see, okay, we do.

Enter an index to delete.

If I enter one, okay, it looks good,

it looks like that's working for us.

We see one here.

So now we need to take that index

and somehow remove the element at that index.

How do we do that?

Well, we use this splice method.

That's one option.

So just to recap splice, let me get out of here,

If I have an array, like what we have to-dos,

if I do a splice, it works to, you know,

remove a section of an array.

So if I do something like splice, you know, from index of,

well, let me add on to to-dos a bit.

To-dos, maybe I'll just do numbers, const nums equals one,

two, three, four, five.

If I do nums.splice, then I specify a starting index,

like index of two, how about, and then a number to delete.

Let's say I wanna delete one. What happens?

Well let's look at nums.

I just deleted element three, which is index of two.

It's kind of confusing, right?

But zero, one, two, and I just deleted one item.

So that's basically what we want to-do.

But this, the initial index that we're starting

to delete at, is not gonna be two,

at least not every time, hardcoded,

it's going to be whatever the user enters.

So we're gonna splice, do it right here,

todos.splice from the user's index

and only for one element.

Now we are trusting that the user enters

a valid index, right, which is fine at this point.

We haven't talked about,

you know, handling errors,

because potentially there could be an error,

especially if the user enters something that's not a number.

We'll just trust that a user can do it,

and then let's console.log something different instead.

This will actually give us the results

that comes back right inside of an array.

If you recall, you can see right here when I call splice,

it gave me back this array

with the element that was deleted.

So if I wanted to, I could save that, deleted stuff,

or just deleted equals todos.splice.

Okay?

And then I'll console.log something like,

okay, deleted,

and then we could actually add in the thing

that was just deleted.

Now that's an array. So I'll do index of zero.

Now you don't have to do this, right?

This is above and beyond,

but lemme just demonstrate it first.

So let me add something new, make,

well, let's not do something dumb.

How about cook dinner?

List.

Okay, index of two, let's try deleting it.

Or let's actually do clean litter box, index of one.

So I'm gonna enter one.

It says, okay, deleted clean litter box.

Now let's list.

And it actually was removed.

We can see here the array has now shrunk.

Just to recap what's happening here, right,

we're asking for an index.

Now again, a user could enter something that is invalid.

Let's see what happens there.

Let's try and delete

with a string index, and, oh, look at that,

deleted collect chicken eggs.

So here's what's going on.

Just as a demo, I've got an array of strings,

and if we, you know, splice from index of one to one, right,

we remove B.

But if I have a string in here, well first of all,

if it's a string containing a number, it will, you know,

try and convert it to a number.

And so that still works.

But if it's a string like this, it just defaults

to zero, index of zero.

So that could be problematic.

If we want to, I guess I can show this,

we can add an extra step in here where we can attempt

to turn this string,

it's always a string from prompt,

turn that into a number with parse int,

like this, parse int of index.

Now honestly I'm embarrassed,

I can't remember if we've covered it yet or not.

If not, parse int again, it takes a string and it returns,

if I can just get out of here, parse int,

like that, a string, you know, like 23,

it gives us the actual number 23.

But if we do something like that, we'll get not a number.

Okay?

So basically what we want to do now is check

if we got not a number,

we're not gonna try and delete something.

You know, that means you entered a string,

or, well, they always entered a string,

but you entered letters or something

that does not contain a valid integer.

So unfortunately checking

to see if something's not a number

is actually kind of complicated.

It's not hard, but we just haven't talked about it.

But there's a method called number-dot,

what is it, is not a number.

And then if we pass something in, you know,

like a number like this, we actually get false.

But if I pass in not a number, we get true.

So again, it's kind of weird,

but what we can do is check to see when you parse

that int on that index.

So let's call that, you know, const,

let's go with this will be, how about string?

What should we call this?

Index string, STR, and then this will be const index

equals parse int of that index string.

So we'll get the string version from a user.

You know what, actually, what I would probably rather do,

I'm sorry for being a bit scatterbrained here,

is just do it in one go:

Ask them and then immediately parse int on their input.

All right, so now we have index

and we're just going to check if number.is not a number

of index.

So if it is not a number, I think I'll actually reverse it

or negate it and just put this code inside.

So if the index that you entered when we converted it

to an actual number, if we did not get not a number,

meaning it's valid, we will try and delete from your to-do.

Otherwise, you know, I'll do something like, hmm,

maybe unknown index and we'll just leave it at that.

Okay, so a bit of a tangent, more complicated than I wanted

to make it, but now hopefully if a user enters

an invalid index, let's see actually if it works, of course.

So let's add an a new to-do, blah-blah,

here's another new one, boo-boo,

and then list them and let's delete blah-blah, index of two.

So delete, and then two.

Okay, let's list them and it's gone.

But now if I try and delete something like this,

unknown index, great,

and hopefully it didn't delete anything.

Well I just typed delete again, I meant to type list.

Let's do another invalid index.

How about, you know, something else you could do is,

is add a check in to make sure the index

was a valid index in the array.

Because what happens if I enter, you know, 88?

Deleted, undefined, so we didn't actually delete anything.

So that's something you could consider adding in.

But for the sake of time, I'm just gonna stop here.

Let's get outta this.

Whoops.

Q.

There we are, we quit the app and we are done.

All right, so this is definitely the longest thing

we've really written so far.

Still not that impressive, I know,

but it's a lot of pieces, especially once we talked about,

you know, parsing ints and you know, working with arrays

and splice and string template literals and conditionals

and a for loop and a while loop.

There's a lot going on here.

So whether you got this on your own

or a small part of it on your own

or you just follow it along with me, either way,

it's definitely an accomplishment in this course.

The one thing I would recommend is making sure

that you can walk through this code

and explain, you know,

what's going on here, what does this mean,

why is there an and, why two not equals,

what's going on here?

What's I, what's the square brackets, you know, to-dos I,

what's splice doing?

Anyway, congrats.

We've made it through a decent chunk of JavaScript,

but as you probably have noticed,

we've got an even decenter chunk to go.

All right, I'll shut up. -->
