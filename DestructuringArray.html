    <!-- Instructor: Next up, destructuring.

So destructuring is another new syntax improvement.

It's a nice way of unpacking or extracting

or singling out values from arrays or from objects.

And we can unpack them,

basically put them into distinct variables.

So let me show you a few examples,

we'll start with arrays.

Imagine that I have an array, like this one right here.

And it has scores that, in this case, they're in order.

Let's say these are pinball scores or something.

And what I want to do is take that first score,

and maybe the second score,

and award them or separate them into separate variables

so that we'll have something like const highScore =,

and then I can do scores[0], right?

And then I can do const secondHighScore = scores[1], right?

And that's singling out this value in this value.

And that works just fine,

but there's actually a much shorter way of doing this.

And that shorter syntax looks like this,

using destructuring, const,

and then array brackets, = scores.

And then, in those array brackets, I can single out,

I want the first value in this array to be called,

let's just go with gold and silver.

That will be the second value.

So let me just show you what gold looks like at this point.

There's gold, 929321.

Let me remind you this is scores.

So the first element was saved to gold.

And then silver is a new variable that was created

with that second element.

Notice scores is unchanged.

So we're not actually extracting something

by removing it from this array,

we're more just copying it over,

the value, into its own variable.

So I could continue with that, I could add bronze in there.

And this would be our bronze score.

So I'm making three variables

based upon these three values in order,

that order matters.

Here's another example.

I used marathon runners.

I think they're marathon, maybe they're just milers,

I don't remember. (snickers)

It's from Wikipedia,

but we have Eliud Kipchoge.

No, he's definitely a marathoner. Okay.

And then, I'm going to butcher this name, I'm sorry.

Feyisa Lelisa.

And then Galen Rupp.

And I did the exact same thing,

[ gold, silver, Bronze ] = raceResults.

Now, we have to have those square brackets there,

the array braces,

to indicate we are destructuring from an array.

So, we had a whole bunch more.

We had, what, like seven values here,

and I only extracted three into standalone variables.

That doesn't really cause a problem at all.

But let's say I wanted everybody else

in a new array called everyoneElse.

I can actually use ..., the rest operator we've seen before,

and then some variable name I'll make up,

like everyoneElse. (snickers)

And now if we take a look at everyoneElse,

it contains everybody who was not called out,

who was not singled out gold, silver, or bronze.

So these four elements.

So it's all based upon position.

This will be the first value in the array,

this will be the second, and this will be the third.

And this, everyoneElse,

will be everything else in the array

that was not singled out.

So that's how we can destructure from an array.

And that is common. Although what is more common

is what we'll see in the next video,

destructuring from objects.
