    <!-- -: Next up, a brand new loop we haven't seen, the for...of.

So, for...of is newer in JavaScript,

it's not just new to us in this course,

but it's also newer in JavaScript,

and unfortunately, that means that it

is not supported in Internet Explorer.

But, that should not stop you from using it.

At least, it should not stop you

from learning it, because it is a lot better,

it's a significant improvement

for iterating over arrays and other iterables.

So, we'll get into what that means.

Here, I have an array of different subreddits on Reddit.

It's just a bunch of strings, doesn't really matter.

Now, if I wanted to print each one out with what we know,

I could do a for loop--

for let i = 0; i < subreddits.length;

and then i++, and then, let's do,

maybe I'll print out a string, so we'll do

console.log, and that string will be a template literal

that will say 'Visit reddit.com/r/'

that will say 'Visit reddit.com/r/'

and then the subreddit name goes right in here.

So dollar sign, curly braces, and then I want

to put 'cringe' or 'books' or 'chickens'

right in there, so I need to access 'subreddits,'

square bracket, i, right?

Inside of those curly braces, that should do it for me.

Let's see.

Refresh the page, open up the console, and it does work.

Now, that's a kind of a lot of--

it's not a huge amount of work,

but it's kind of a lot of weird syntax

just to iterate over an array, right?

We've gotta work with i.

So that does work, it's just not as clean

as the for...of loop, which we'll take a look at right now.

It looks like this--

for, and then in parentheses, some variable name

that we come up with, of-- the actual word of--

some iterable thing.

So to start, that iterable thing will be an array.

So, I could rewrite this like this--

for, let-- and then I need to come up

with a variable name, and it's actually going to represent

the individual elements in my array.

So, for, let-- let's go with "sub of subreddits."

Just like that.

Now, this is a significant difference.

I'm making a variable here called "sub,"

and if I just console.log that sub...

Let's just make sure that works. There we go!

It's actually representing, it's storing each element

in the array.

We don't have to worry about i, the index,

because right here, we're just making this i variable

the index for the sole purpose

of accessing individual elements out of the array.

We're never using i to do any math.

We don't really care about what i is,

except for the fact that it helps us get out each element.

But here, this is shorter, but it's also

a lot easier to read.

Let sub of subreddits.

I could name this "subreddit," I could name this anything.

This is just a variable that will exist each time

through the loop, and it will store,

the first time through, 'cringe,'

and then 'books,' and then 'chickens,' and then 'funny.'

So, if I wanted to just match what we have here,

I would just add "sub" right there.

Or if I name this "subreddit," make sure I have two Ds

in there, "subreddit," just like that.

I just need to match what I have,

and there we go, we get the same outcome,

but this is a lot nicer in my opinion.

For...of is certainly an improvement

over regular for loops.

Not in every situation, but for situations

where you're iterating over something like an array

and you don't need the index, you don't care about it.

If you do need the index, and sometimes there are situations

where you need that index, it can be better

to use a for loop.

So, here's an example, though,

where I'm using two for loops, nested,

"i" and "j" are the two variable names I came up with,

very standard, very boring, and honestly,

not very easy to read.

If I rewrote this using for...of loops,

all that I'm doing is looping over the seatingChart

where we have three different rows,

I'm looping over into each row

and then over each student and printing them out.

Nothing very exciting.

But I could rewrite it like this--

for(let row of seatingChart).

Just like that.

And then inside of here--

for(let student of row)...

And then console.log(student).

So, a lot easier to read because I can actually write

a variable that corresponds to the individual element,

not a variable that corresponds

to an index or just a number that I then have

to plug into the array.

Here, I don't have to plug anything into the array.

"Row" references each element in the parent,

in the first array.

And then for let student of that row array,

student references this, and then this, and then this.

And I think overall, that's pretty easy,

and it's just way better to look at,

and way better to write.

It's a far better experience.

We can verify that it does give us the same outcome.

And it does, so here's the first batch,

all the way down to Erika.

And then here's the second batch, exactly the same outcome.

So, for...of loops. Massive improvement.

Now, let's revisit what I said

about iterable objects, right here.

Oh, here we go.

A nice and easy way of iterating over arrays

or other iterable objects.

So there are other things

that we can use a for...of loop with.

I'll show you another example, which is a string--

for, let-- let's do "char" for character,

of, and then...

Hm, I don't know, what should--

I guess, "hello world," it's not very exciting,

but we could do that, console.log(char), sure.

Just like that.

And there we go, h-e-l-l-o, space,

blah blah blah blah blah,

each character is being iterated over.

So "char" is going to be "h," and then it will be "e,"

and then "l," and then "l," so that's just one example

of iterating over something that is not an array.

Now, there are other iterable objects.

If we go to MDN, you take a look at the page for for...of,

there are things like maps and sets,

which we have not yet talked about.

One thing that I see a lot of students attempt

to do is work with objects in for...of,

and that's actually the subject

of the next video, so I'm not gonna get ahead of myself.

But long story short, most commonly,

for...of is used with arrays.

You can use it with other things

that are considered "iterables" by JavaScript,

like strings, that's really all we know so far.

And the syntax is super nice, compact--

for, some variable, of, some iterable,

do something, usually using that variable.

Cool. -->
