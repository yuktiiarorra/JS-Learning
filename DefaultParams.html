    <!-- Instructor: So the first of these newer features

we'll look at is default params or default parameters.

Often when we write a function,

we'll have some parameter,

and it may be optional.

If a user passes it in, we'll use it,

and if they don't, we'd like to give it a default value.

For example, let's go back to this good old function

we've written a couple of times, roll a die.

And let's say that this rollDie function

accepts a number of sides.

So we'll call that numSides.

So we're rolling a six-sided die, a 10-sided,

a 20-sided or whatever number of sides for our die.

And we want to return our good old friend here Math.floor

of Math.random times the number of sides

and then plus one to shift that.

So if I pass in numSides of six,

let's just verify over here.

rollDie.

I'll pass in six.

We should get a number from one to six and we do.

Now if I try that instead with 20,

we should get a number between one and 20.

And it looks like that's working as well.

But let's say that I want to allow a user

to just default numSides if they don't pass it in.

I want it to be six because that's the most commonly sized

or most common sized die.

So if I try that right now, if I don't pass it in,

we get our good friend,

equally good friend not a number.

And that makes sense because it's undefined.

And that means we'd be using undefined here.

And multiplying Math.random by undefined,

that always gives us not a number.

So that's not good.

So in the past,

before this syntax improvement I'm about to show you,

this is what we would do.

We would check to see if a value,

if a parameter was undefined.

So something like right here.

So this is a one-line way of doing it.

So you do something like this.

If numSides equals undefined,

then numSides equals six.

So let's try that now.

rollDie.

You don't pass in parentheses.

(sighs) You don't pass in parentheses.

You don't pass in a number, it defaults to six.

But if you do pass something in like 20,

you can see that it's working.

It's not just defaulting to six anymore.

So this was the old way of doing things,

and it's kind of annoying.

It's not ideal,

especially if you have more than one parameter

that's optional.

Now, the new way of doing it is

using this syntax improvement

where we add an equal sign and a default value directly

in our parameter list.

So in this example, multiply,

A has no default value.

A will be whatever you passed in as the first argument.

B does have a default value.

If you leave it off, it will default to one.

So we could rewrite this function right here like this.

rollDie (numSides).

If you leave it off, equals six.

And that's it.

This is easier to read, right?

And it's just more compact.

It's a nicer alternative.

Let's verify.

You pass in 20.

We get our larger range 20-sided die.

If you pass in nothing, we go from one to six,

our six-sided die.

So we can write multiple default params,

but one thing you need to watch out for is the order.

So if I wrote a very trivial,

stupid honestly, silly, dumb,

ridiculous function like greet,

and greet is expecting a message

that you'll pass in and a person,

and it's going to return something very simple

like the message comma the person's name,

and then an exclamation point.

So I would call it like this.

And actually, instead of returning, let's just print.

Okay, so we print that out, and I call greet.

I pass in a message like hello.

I don't know why I'm doing all caps.

And then a person's name.

How about Joaquin?

Okay.

Then we get hello, Joaquin with an exclamation point.

Or if I do someone else's name or some other greeting

like up top big guy, there we go.

Up top big guy, Joaquin.

All right.

Let's say I wanna make message have a default value.

So I want message, if you don't pass one in,

just to default to hey there.

Just like that, okay?

Let's see what happens.

So I try calling greet and I pass in both hello and Joaquin.

That works.

But what if I just pass in Joaquin?

Well, hopefully you can see what the issue is here.

JavaScript isn't smart enough

to know that this is a person's name

and that it should use the default for message.

It's going off of the order, and that's it.

So this is the first thing we passed in.

It's going to be applied

to that first parameter here, message.

And then person is undefined.

So the order matters, and you cannot...

I mean, I guess technically you can have a default parameter

at the beginning before other parameters

that don't have a default value,

but it's just not gonna work.

So you should always have your default parameters

come second or third or whatever it is.

They need to come after any parameters that are not default.

And you can also have multiple of them.

So we could have a message.

Let me just verify and show you that that does work.

Greet Joaquin.

We get hey there, Joaquin.

But if we pass something else in after like hi like that,

we get hi, Joaquin.

Okay, lastly,

we can put something else in here like punctuation.

Let's call it punc.

And it will be a default of just one exclamation point.

So we'll put that in right there right after the fact.

So if we try calling greet,

this time with Rosa,

we get hey there, Rosa with one exclamation point.

But if I pass in a greeting like hiya and punctuation,

I want a whole bunch of exclamation points,

I don't know why I'm not being consistent

with my quotes there,

I need double quotes,

you can see that we're not relying

on any of the default parameters.

So that's all there is to default params.

Using that equal sign,

it's a significant improvement over something like this.

New feature, use it, it's nice.

Okay.
