Null, Undefined are neither a string, nor a Boolean. They are actual values in JavaScript. 
Undefined
JavaScript's way of saying, "I don't know. I don't know what you want. I don't know the value. It's not defined." It is not something that we set ourselves usually,
or that we use. We don't set a variable to undefined. Undefined, instead, is a concept that just means something not being there, not being defined. Undefined is something
that we will run into pretty frequently. Especially later on once we start working with more methods and writing our own functions etc.
Null
It is the intentional lack of value. And this is something that we assign. So it's a value. We can make a variable and set it to null.
Null is something we won't run into really very often at all. It is something we may set as a value for a variable.
null // it is a variable and returns the same
null
true // it is a variable and returns the same
true
false // it is a variable and returns the same
false
undefined // it is a variable and returns the same
undefined
"hello"[99] // index 99 doesn't exist
undefined
let x; // I don't give it a value so it's initially set to undefined. i.e. it does not have a defined value.
undefined
x
undefined
For example, if we have a variable called loggedInUser. And initially, there is no logged in user, we could set it to false or to zero or to, I don't know,
an empty string, or we could set it to null, which clearly indicates, explicitly, there is nothing here. It's just the concept of nothing,
let loggedInUser = null;
undefined
loggedInUser = 'Alan Rickman';
'Alan Rickman'
