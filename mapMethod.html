    <!-- Instructor: The next of these callback array methods

we'll see is called map.

So map is similar to forEach in the sense

that it accepts a callback function

and it runs that function once per element in the array.

But what's very different is that it then generates

a new array using the result,

using the return value of that callback.

So it's a way to map an array from one state to another.

We could double every number.

Or in this example, I have a text array

with some lowercase strings,

and then I'm calling texts.map.

We pass in our callback function

and I'm using t as a parameter here, return t.toUpperCase.

So whatever that return value is,

coming back from this callback function,

map is going to take that

and add it into a new array that it creates and it returns,

and I can save it under the variable caps.

So I'll show you some examples here. Here is numbers.

Once again, our lovely array of just consecutive integers.

And let's say I wanna double every single one.

I could do this, numbers.map,

and then I pass in my callback.

For each num,

I said for each, but we're not actually

using the function forEach.

I'm just saying do this for each num,

and then create a new array with it.

Thank you map, that's what you're supposed to do.

So for num, that's our parameter here.

N-U-M, I'm going to return

num times two.

So it's gonna call this function on every element.

So it's gonna call it on one. So num will be one.

We return two.

And it sticks that in a new array,

and then we pass in two, or it does, map does.

So two is passed to this function.

Well that returns four,

and that's added to a new array

that it constructs based upon our initial array, numbers.

So it doesn't mutate numbers,

it doesn't change it in any way,

but it makes a new array for us.

And then I can save that to a variable, const doubles.

Let's take a look. Here is doubles.

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on.

So we've taken every element

and it's been run through this function

that we passed into map,

and that generates a new array with the results.

So let's try working with the movies array this time

where we've got our objects

and maybe I just wanna form an array

just of the movie titles.

That's it.

So to do that, I could use map, movies.map,

and then my function, movie.

And all I'll return is not the movie object,

but movie.title.

So I'm mapping over that, each element in this array,

and then I'm just saying return the title,

and put that in a new array.

Return the title, return the title.

So if I save that to a variable,

const titles = movies.map.

Let's take a look. There we are.

We have an array of titles.

Or I could do something entirely different.

I could do movie.title.toUpperCase, just like that.

Take a look at titles.

Now we've got our uppercased movie titles.

So we're just taking data in an array, a starting array,

and usually transforming it

as we map it into a new copied array.

So we could just use map to make a direct copy.

I could literally just return movie, in this case,

but there's easier ways of doing that.

So it's typically used when we need a portion of our data

or we want to, I mean, doubling something's not very common.

But when we need to transform every element

in some starting array and create a new array

based upon that starting array, map is often a good choice.

So it accepts callback,

it runs that callback on every element,

and it takes that return value we get back

and it shoves it in a new array that it returns to us

that we can then save in a variable or do something with.

So that's an intro to map.

Instructor: So now that we've learned a bit

about arrow functions,

let's revisit things like map and forEach,

and see how we could use arrow functions there

to shorten things up even more.

So here's our movies array, once again,

with our four movie objects.

And let's say I want to map over them.

We'll use a typical function expression first.

And for each movie here, what should we return

in the new array we're creating with map?

Let's do basically the same thing that we did earlier.

Maybe instead of doing out of 100, let's divide by 10,

so we'll get 9.5 or 9.0, that sort of thing.

So, we'll return our template literal string here,

back ticks, and then the movie title.

So right there, movie.title.

And then the score, which is movie.score.

Let's try dividing by 10.

So let's see what that looks like.

Save that to variable const,

what should we call this?

Just, I don't know, newMovies. (chuckles)

And that's what it looks like right there,

"Amadeus - 9.9", "Stand By Me - 8.5".

Okay.

Alrighty. So if I wanted to rewrite this

using an arrow function, it's pretty simple.

I can really shrink it down, so I can do const.

I'll just comment it out.

newMovies is kind of a terrible name.

movies.map, and then my arrow function.

And what is my parameter here?

Well, I'll just call it movie, still, movie like that.

And then, in here,

I can just copy this string if I wanted to.

So that's a little bit of an improvement.

Also, remember, I can get rid of those parentheses.

And also, remember, I can get rid of the curly braces,

replace them with parens,

and get rid of the return keyword.

Like that.

Now we have our implicit return,

we can just verify it still works.

Take a look at newMovies.

Okay, it's still good.

And I could even do this on one line if I wanted to.

Just like that. Now, I personally think

it's too long to do that

when we're doing this long string template literal,

so I wouldn't, but it is totally valid and it still works.

So I would probably keep it at this right there.

Still, definitely shorter than what we had before.

You don't have to write the function keyword,

you don't need return,

it's just a little bit cleaner.

So this is where arrow functions pop up a lot,

is when we're passing a function

into another function or a method.

So we're passing in this function here to map,

or to forEach, or to some of the other methods

we're about to see.

It just really cleans things up.

All right, that is pretty much it.

That's a wrap on error functions.
